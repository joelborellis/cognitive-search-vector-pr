# Vector search samples - Azure AI Search

This repository has code samples for [vector support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-overview) in Azure AI Search. Vector search is generally available, but it also has capabilities still in preview, under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

- Vector indexing and queries are generally available. 
- [Integrated data chunking and vectorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization), which takes a dependency on indexers and skillsets, is in preview.

## Content

| Sample | Description | Status |
| ------ | ------------|--------|
| [DotNetVectorDemo](demo-dotnet/DotNetVectorDemo/readme.md) | A .NET console app that calls Azure OpenAI to vectorize data. It then calls Azure AI Search to create, load, and query vector data.| Generally available (GA) |
| [DotNetIntegratedVectorizationDemo](demo-dotnet/DotNetIntegratedVectorizationDemo/readme.md) | A .NET console app that calls Azure AI Search to create an index, indexer, data source, and skillset. An Azure Storage account provides the data. Azure OpenAI is called by the skillset during indexing, and again during query execution to vectorize text queries. | Public preview |
| [JavaScriptVectorDemo](demo-javascript/JavaScriptVectorDemo/readme.md) | There are three code samples. One is an end-to-end code sample that calls Azure OpenAI for embeddings and Azure AI Seach to create, load, and query an index that contains vectors. Another sample calls just Azure OpenAI and is used to generate embeddings for fields in an index. The last one also calls just Azure OpenAI and is used to generate an embedding for a vector query. | GA |
| [demo-python/*.ipynb](demo-python/readme.md) |  A collection of notebooks that demonstrate aspects of vector search, including data chunking and vectorization of both text and image content. | GA and preview | 
| [postman-collection](postman-collection/README.md)| Two separate Postman collections of REST API calls for generally available (2023-11-01) and preview (2023-10-01-preview) versions. GA version shows you how to create, load, and query vector and non-vector content in an index. Preview version demonstrates integrated data chunking and vectorization through indexers and skillsets. Use the [Postman app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for these samples. | GA and preview |
