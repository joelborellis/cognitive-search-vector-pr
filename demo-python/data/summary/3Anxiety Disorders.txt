The excerpt appears to discuss the diagnosis of two specific mental disorders – Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Panic Disorder. 

Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by an irrational fear, anxiety, and avoidance of social interactions due to the fear of being negatively evaluated by others. This fear often leads to impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning. It affects about 7% of the population in the United States, with women being more affected than men. The onset is typically during early teens, often emerging from childhood history of social inhibition or shyness. Environmental factors, such as negative social experiences, peer victimization, childhood maltreatment, and ethnic discrimination, can increase the risk of developing this disorder. Genetic factors also play a crucial role in predisposition to SAD. The disorder is comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, and in children, comorbidities with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and selective mutism are common. 

According to the excerpt, Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, followed by persistent concern about additional panic attacks or their consequences, leading to significant maladaptive behavior changes. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of fear or discomfort, with four or more physical or cognitive symptoms reaching their peak within minutes. The term ‘unexpected’ means that there are no obvious cues or triggers for these attacks, it appears to occur 'out of the blue’. Panic attacks may also vary widely in their frequency and severity. The diagnosis is made based on the nature and context of the panic attacks, differential diagnosis with other mental disorders, and is not attributed to another medical condition or substance use disorder.
