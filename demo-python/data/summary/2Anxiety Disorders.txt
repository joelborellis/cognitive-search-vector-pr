Summary:

The excerpt above discusses Specific Phobia and Social Anxiety Disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses (DSM-5-TV). 

Specific Phobia is characterized by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other essential functioning areas related to the fear of a particular object or situation. For diagnosis, the phobia must increase physiological arousal during exposure or anticipated exposure to the object or situation. Moreover, the abnormal physiological response differs among types of phobias. For example, blood-injection-injury specific phobia often results in a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response. The condition is more common in women than men and usually develops in early childhood. Many factors contribute to the onset of Specific Phobia, including traumatic events, vicarious traumatization, unexpected panic attacks, and informational transmission. Prognostic factors include temperamental factors like neuroticism, environmental aspects such as parental overprotectiveness, and genetic predisposition. It's crucial to consider the cultural, age, and gender-related diagnostic issues in such cases.

On the other hand, Social Anxiety Disorder, also known as Social Phobia, is defined as the fear or anxiety about one or more social situations where the subject is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. The key features of this disorder include fear that they will be negatively evaluated (fears such as being seen as anxious, weak, crazy, etc.), children must show anxiety in peer settings, and social situations consistently provoke fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety must be persistent, typically lasting for six months or more, and should cause substantial distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other salient functioning areas. Comorbidity is widespread with other conditions, including other anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders, and some personality disorders. 

These disorders can lead to significant interruptions and distress in an individualâ€™s social, educational, or occupational functioning, depending on severity.
