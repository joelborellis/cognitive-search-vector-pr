The above excerpt is primarily centered on Panic Disorder. 

- Diagnosis of Panic Disorder relies on the patient experiencing multiple unexpected full-symptom panic attacks. The symptoms often include worries related to physical health, social judgment, and losing control or going crazy. Panic attacks can occur both during the day and at night, and nocturnal panic attacks are often observed in people with daytime attacks. Those experiencing both types are noted to have more severe panic disorder overall.

- The prevalence of Panic Disorder is about 2%-3% in adults and adolescents in the US and several European countries. It occurs more frequently in females than males. However, lower prevalence rates are reported among Latinx, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and Asian Americans. 

- Panic Disorder tends to onset in early adulthood, around 20-24 years old, but can occur at any age. The course of this disorder is typically chronic, often complicated by other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders. 

- Risk factors include: temperamental factors such as negative affectivity, anxiety sensitivity, and behavioral inhibition; environmental factors such as identifiable stressors and traumatic experiences; and genetic factors, although exact details of these are still unknown.

- Panic Disorder is associated with many cultural and psychological challenges. It's common for individuals with panic disorder to worry about panic attacks or their consequences, which can sometimes lead to discrimination and other social issues. 

- The consequences of Panic Disorder include high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well as considerable economic costs and high medical expenses. 

- Differential diagnoses to consider include: Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, and Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature. 

- Panic Disorder often co-occurs with other mental disorders such as other anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. In the general population, 80% of individuals with panic disorder had a lifetime comorbid mental diagnosis. 

- The “Panic Attack Specifier” refers to symptoms of a panic attack but these are not presented in the excerpt.
