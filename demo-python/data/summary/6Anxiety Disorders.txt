The excerpt outlines two potentially identified mental conditions: Agoraphobia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 

1) Agoraphobia is characterized by fear, anxiety or avoidance of situations such as public transportation or being outside the home alone. The frequency and severity of these fears should persist for six months or longer to meet the diagnostic criteria. Also, they should be out of proportion to the actual danger posed and should cause significant distress or impairment in essential areas of functioning. Agoraphobia, in its severe form, can result in individuals being housebound and dependent on others. It commonly co-occurs with panic attacks and has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 1%â€“1.7% among adolescents and adults globally. Onset typically occurs before the age of 35, and it frequently coexists with other disorders such as depression and substance abuse disorders. 

2) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is marked by excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least six months, about several events or activities. The individual finds it hard to control the worry, and the anxiety and worry are associated with three or more symptoms like restlessness, being easily fatigued, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. GAD causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, and other essential areas of functioning. It is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. The prevalence of GAD is 0.9% among adolescents and 2.9% among adults. It is chronic and tends to wax and wane across the lifespan. It is more frequent in individuals of European descent and is reported more frequently in high-income countries.
