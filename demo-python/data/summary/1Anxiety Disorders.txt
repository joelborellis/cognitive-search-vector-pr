From the long passage, we can identify three specific disorders. They are Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism, and Specific Phobia. We shall summarize each disorder its diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis, and comorbidities.

1. Separation Anxiety Disorder:
Diagnostic Criteria: Involved is an excessive worry about real or imagined separation from key attachment figures (like parents) or places of safety and security. The individual may have significant distress during separation and persistently try to avoid being separated.
Differential Diagnosis: This is differentiated from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Conduct Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Illness Anxiety Disorder, Prolonged Grief Disorder, Depressive and Bipolar Disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Psychotic Disorders. 
Comorbidity: Common comorbidities include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Specific Phobia, PTSD, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Agoraphobia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Prolonged grief disorder, and Personality Disorders.

2. Selective Mutism:
Diagnostic Criteria: This refers to a consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where there is an expectation for speaking, such as at school, even when the individual is capable of speaking in other situations.
Differential Diagnosis: This differs from situations like a silent period in immigrant children learning a second language, Communication disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders, and Social Anxiety Disorder.
Comorbidity: The most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and oppositional behaviors. 

3. Specific Phobia:
Diagnostic Criteria: The individual possesses marked fear or anxiety about a precise object or situation (like flying, heights, animals, receiving injections, seeing blood), which provokes immediate fear or anxiety and is actively avoided.
Differential Diagnosis: The disorder needs to be differentiated from those fear, anxiety, and avoidance associated with panic-like symptoms, obsessions, traumatic events, separation from loved ones, social situations, etc.
Comorbidity: Individuals with Specific Phobia often fear multiple objects or situations, these can be multiple specific phobias. 

In summary, each disorder includes specific criteria and can often be distinguished from other disorders through careful analysis of the individual's symptoms in relation to other conditions. Comorbidity is prevalent, with individuals often diagnosed with multiple disorders co-occurring.
