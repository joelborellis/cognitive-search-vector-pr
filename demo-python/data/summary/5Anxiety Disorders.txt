The excerpt describes Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks, Agoraphobia, and associated features and diagnostic criteria of each.

Panic Attacks are identified by an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort, which peak within minutes, and during which four or more listed symptoms like palpitations, sweating, trembling, feelings of choking and fear of dying occur. These attacks are categorized as 'expected' or 'unexpected' based on the presence of an obvious trigger.

Diagnostics for panic attacks are largely dependent on the symptoms exhibited by the patient and careful evaluation by a practitioner. Associated features include nocturnal panic attacks. They can occur in the context of other mental conditions like anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, etc. or medical conditions.

Agoraphobia is described as a condition marked by significant fear or anxiety triggered by exposure to a range of situations like public transportation, open spaces, enclosed places, standing in crowds, and being outside alone. Diagnostic criteria for Agoraphobia includes the fear disproportionate to the actual danger posed by the situation and the avoidance of these situations, either physically or cognitively.

The excerpt also explores various associated features for each condition like prevalence, development and course, risk and prognostic factors, cultural diagnostic issues, sex- and gender-related diagnostic issues, and functional consequences of these conditions. 

The text insists on differential diagnosis for Panic attacks considering other medical or physiological conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, etc.

For comorbidity, panic attacks in conjunction with other mental disorders can lead to increased symptomatic severity, higher rates of comorbidity, and poorer treatment response.
