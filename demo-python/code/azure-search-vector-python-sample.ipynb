      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Score: 0.8590963\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Content: social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Score: 0.80100083\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling\n",

      "Content: Chapter 6. Teaching mobilizers where they learn.  Where do your customers and mobilizers especially learn? We've put that question to hundreds of commercial organizations, sales and marketing alike. It's a deceptively simple question, but you might be surprised at how few commercial organizations have a firm grasp on the answer. And for good reason. Where customers learn has been a moving target, with the explosion of both digital and social media channels that customers tend to trust far more than classic marketing channels. Moreover, when you nail down the answer to this question and make no mistake, you do have to know this. Engaging mobilizers where they learn is going to feel hard. Because they are learning in lots of different places. They're following varied learning paths. They're learning from peers and subject matter experts in social networks where the rules of engagement are different than what marketing or sales are used to. According to CEB research, the average B2B customer consults nearly a dozen sources of information spread across all varieties of touch points on the path to purchase. Only half of that information comes from suppliers in total. So if you're an individual supplier and say you're one of four that a customer knows to seek information from, you've got about 12% share of information that customer is consuming. No wonder it feels hard just breaking through all the noise. On top of that, you have to teach customers at arms length in all these places. In other words, with little to no human engagement. How are you going to do that? Sounds like a job for great content, you say? Well, yes and no. Yes, on content that's going to be critical to teach customers to change their direction while they are learning in a noisy information marketplace. But no, in that almost all the conventional wisdom on content marketing leads us away from the kind of intervention suppliers need to be doing with mobilizers to change their direction in that 57%. The dark side of content marketing. At the risk of oversimplifying, there are three high level points of guidance we repeatedly hear in the massive amount of content and marketing created to explain content marketing. One look smart. You need to be a thought leader by representing an expert perspective. When the customer is in the market for a solution in your space, they'll think of you first. To be useful. Create content that speaks to customer pain points. Look to customer search patterns and create content that provides answers to what customers are looking for. Have content that is practically useful in the customer's day-to-day routine. Three, be present. Create customer personas. Publish content on a regular cadence to engage those different personas on what is relevant to each of them in the information sources they use. Each in its own way, is a tiger trap for suppliers looking to teach mobilizers where they are learning. Let's take them in turn. Look smart. The problem here is that the vast majority of content written in the name of thought leadership focuses on building up the B and completely overlooks tearing down the A. Bottom line, customers aren't going to change unless we give them a good reason to. That's the tiger trap of thought leadership. Think about it. If the Xerox marketing team had pursued a classic thought leadership strategy, they would have created content about the trends related to their differentiators. It would have been blog posts with titles like 5 Things You Didn't Know About Document Security or a Customer Testimonial on the Benefits of adopting distributed printing. Or an entertaining video of a lab coated chemist talking about trends in use of solid ink printing. Those are all about the B. What life would be like if only you appreciated what's going on at the cutting edge of printing these days. That may be enough to get the customer to view you as an expert supplier, but is it enough to fundamentally change their current behavior? CEB research suggests no, not even close. Be useful? By definition, this line of conventional thinking has suppliers speaking to customer pain points that customers realize they have. What are they searching for? Let's write content that speaks to that. Even if it doesn't relate directly back to the suppliers solution. It's an attention play. That's well-intentioned advice in a very noisy marketplace. Many marketers will take that attention. But it's grossly insufficient. If suppliers are going to upend mental models with their commercial insight, they ought to be talking about problems that mobilizers don't realize they have. Mobilizers won't know to be searching on it in the first place, so analyzing search patterns and writing content that speaks strictly to those search terms isn't going to help us shift how mobilizers think about their business. In other words, suppliers who follow the BE Useful advice might be ringing up blog clicks and engagement metrics, but none of that is feeding through to any kind of meaningful sales activity. Marketing qualified lead? Sure. High quality deal closed. Not likely. Be present. This is all about coverage. The problem here is the sheer volume of content that suppliers have to create and deploy. The back of envelope math on this It's really ugly, really fast. For example, take a conservative calculation. Four personas times five touch points times four pieces of content per month times four business units equals 320 pieces of content per month, or close to 4000 pieces of content annually. And that probably understates by at least half what most mid size or large enterprises would be facing. Very quickly, the content tail wags the dog as a big flashing light on the editorial calendar starts flashing red because no new blog post is in the queue for next week's submission deadline. You're left thinking in a panic. We need more content. Fill the hole in the content calendar, make the deadline. Get it done. We speak with marketers all the time who find themselves in this feed the content beast rut. They inexorably fall prey to putting content quantity over content quality. That's the tiger trap of be present. If this sounds familiar, you aren't alone. From all of our structured interviews with marketing organizations, we estimate over 85% are in some form of the coverage, right? The real devil with all of these content approaches is the opportunity cost. Every ounce of energy and resource that goes into creating and deploying look smart, be useful, be present content crowds out the energy and resource needed to create surprising content that has a chance to truly change the customers direction. To give that mobilizer the surprising insight about her business and the agitation that pain of same is greater than pain of change. If suppliers don't hit that mark, their content is unlikely to actually redirect the train from rolling into commoditization station. But how does suppliers create content that does that? What does that look like? Creating challenging content paths. If the primary goal of marketing content is to break down the customers A and then build up a B, then suppliers should ensure that all of their content is somehow tied to that goal. In other words, once they have created a commercial insight, marketers need to step back and create a related content strategy. That strategy will lay out the content paths that lead mobilizers on an ever deeper exploration of a commercial insight that simultaneously changes the way they think about their business and leads them ever closer to valuing the suppliers unique strengths. Not that every piece of content must get them to buy, per se, but imagine if every piece of content were built back from a single powerful insight, all thematically aligned, leading to an ever deeper treatment of that topic. The goal there is to get them to explore. As long as the exploration is designed to lead them exclusively back to you, the deeper the exploration, the better. However, most supplier content, thematically speaking, is just the opposite. It's scattered all over the place. That's no surprise, given the look smart, be useful, be present conventional wisdom in content marketing. That kind of approach leads marketers to create content on a very wide array of topics for very different personas, and to scatter it as far and wide as possible. This is B2P marketing run amok as marketers seek to match the speed of their content output to the increasingly complex diversity of the 5.4 stakeholders. Yet notice how this strategy doesn't build a consistent path or message to anywhere, as each piece is largely independent of every other. As a result, customers may come away with the notion that you have a lot of smart things to say, but that's about it. They may think differently about you, but they're far less likely to think any differently of themselves. On the other hand, when you lay a purposeful path with your content so it's all tied together thematically to a single provocative insight, you get a different output altogether. In this world, all the content is linked almost like a trail of bread crumbs, leading back to a single commercial insight purposefully designed to change the way customers and specifically mobilizers think about their business. What's especially powerful here? Each one of these links in that narrative chain provides a potential hook to catch a mobilizer and a possible rallying point for forging consensus. So how do marketers build that path? Let's unpack this and then bring it to life with the Xerox example. First off, the whole idea here is to have all of the content you produce publish and curate all the blog posts, all the testimonials and case studies, all the white papers, all the infographics, you name it. Lead to a commercial insight. There are three mental steps that mobilizers, or any customer stakeholder for that matter, go through to have their A state challenged, creating the drive for them to rally other stakeholders and mobilize change toward a bee state. The first step is to spark exploration of the frame breaking idea at the heart of your commercial insight. You need your content here to hook the mobilizer into revisiting her mental model in the first place. That might be a killer infographic or an intriguing tweet. Individual sales reps increasingly have a role to play here as micro marketers deploying marketing curated sparks in social networks. The thought bubble you're looking for that mobilizer to have is. I never thought of it that way before. I need to learn more, or I'm not sure I believe it, but I'm kind of intrigued. Tell me more. Having gotten the mobilizer to want to learn more from the Spark content, the Introduce Content second step lays out the idea in more detail. It presents the rational evidence and makes a powerful emotional appeal that breaks the customer's frame. That could be an animated video or an interactive white paper or a trade show booth. You want your mobilizer to come away from this content. With the thought bubble, I get the insight. Conceptually, I believe it could be true generally, but I wonder how that plays out in my world, in my business. That's when you pass the mobilizer to Confront Content, the third step. This is where you confront the mobilizer with the frame breaking idea in her own terms. You dial up her pain so that she can't escape the sense that the pain of same is greater than the pain of change. By the way, this isn't about pressuring the mobilizer as a person in any way. Rather, it is diplomatically but convincingly, leading the mobilizer to pressure test her own ideas, assumptions and beliefs about her business. Often these kinds of content are online diagnostics or interactive pain calculators, which enable the mobilizer to plug in information about her own reality so that she can see where the gaps are or how big the pain really is. The thought bubble coming off this content should be holy cow. I had no idea we were taking this kind of hit. I need to learn more about fixing this. We'll refer to this spark introduce Confront Content Progression as an SIC content strategy. Through a progression like this you've blown up the mobilizers mental model through compelling content at Arms length. You've broken down the A state. At this point you can path mobilizers to content that builds up the B state. But we can't overstress that customers who consume only Bee State content are unlikely to feel the need to break from current course and speed. When you put it all together, if you're looking to teach mobilizers with content like this, it boils down to three rules. Rule 1. All content should be tied in some way to a commercial insight. Rule 2. Content that isn't itself frame breaking should directly path back to content that is. Rule 3. All other content should be discarded or never created in the first place. This won't be easy to do. It means discarding content that doesn't fit the model. As we've spent time with CEB members running content audits on their existing content portfolios, we find that there are often pieces of existing content that can be repurposed for Spark, introduce or confront. And white papers that can be atomized into bite sized pieces with some atoms being repurposed and others disappearing altogether. Blog posts that can be repurposed. Sales decks with pages that can be torn out and used. And then there will always be the practical spec sheets that are necessary for the transactional parts of the selling process. Those can stay, but you can't lead with them, You have to lead to them. But we don't want to understate the importance of staying tightly aligned to these CSIC content paths. Stay on message. Keep beating the drum. Tear down the A before you build up the B. This is a big shift for marketers. For the majority of content types you produce, following this content strategy will shift the focus from supplier centric to supplier agnostic. That will feel really unnatural at first. For example, most marketers are used to creating customer testimonial videos focused on the bee. Over 90% of the testimonial videos we review from marketers focus on the B. To create content paths that break mental models and Dr. urgency. Instead, they'll have to start creating testimonials about the A. Imagine creating video testimonials of mobilizers, talking about how they discovered a hidden connection in their business and how it was costing them so much more than they realized. And then how they rallied the 5.4 around a consensus view of the drivers of that pain and what kind of solution it would take to solve it. You want these kinds of acetate testimonials to lead back to your commercial insight and the differentiators underneath that insight. It's a really different approach but it's so important to breaking down the A and changing the customers direction. Testimonials are but one kind of content. We've seen marketers apply ISIC principles all over the content portfolio, from trade show booths to white paper design to online buying toolkits. Less is more. Done well, a tightly managed SIRC content strategy should lead marketers to create less content than they currently do, but drive greater impact on the commercial metrics that matter. Why would that be? Among other things, disruptive ideas naturally garner more earned media attention. They are more likely to get shared or earn coverage from other outlets with broader reach than what suppliers can achieve alone through their often modest owned and paid media efforts. We know this from data, not just experience. Based on empirical research into what gets shared in today's digital environment, two of the most important traits that predict sharing are tightly aligned to disruptive content. That is, content that is awe inspiring and surprising gets shared much more often than typical news or practical information. This comes from a fascinating study by Jonah Berger and Catherine Milkman of the University of Pennsylvania about which articles got shared and which didn't by New York Times readers. According to the authors, awe inspiring content is defined as having two components. Its scale is large and it requires mental accommodation by forcing the reader to view the world in a different way. These two traits are nearly perfectly aligned to commercial insight and our model of content. Commercial insight is by definition surprising because it counters existing mental models. That kind of attention is critical in today's noisy marketplace because what gets shared or picked up by non supplier affiliated sources tends to get more attention and trust. With B to B marketing budgets what they are. Well short of what it would take to satiate a hungry content beast, surprising content will make marketing resources go much further. Less can be so much more. To show you how, let's take a look at some examples of how a Spark introduced Confront Content Strategy plays out in practice. Example one. Dentsply. The SI C Content Framework becomes a very powerful tool for determining which content to create and which content should never see the light of day. As an illustrative example, take the dense PLY commercial Insight. Please note this example is not necessarily reflective of dense plies actual marketing efforts and is merely meant to illustrate how dense plies insight could potentially be turned into an effective content path. Recall that dense plies insight is related to dental hygienists absenteeism causing dentists more pain than they ever realized, and how it's actually controllable with the proper dental instruments. Now suppose you're a dense plume marketer charged with developing a content strategy that will upend the mental models of mobilizers inside of dental practices. Spark content, for example, would include infographics on average yearly cost of hygienist absenteeism, including a breakout of all the hidden or indirect costs that a dentist faces with that absenteeism. You'll want to build numerous Spark content pieces like this to provide on ramps for your customers and mobilizers in all the places they go to learn. Again, you're just trying to get the mobilizer who sees this to think, huh. I didn't realize the cost was that high. I wonder why. By contrast, Spark content would not include A blog post on why you need a dental app for your practice or a web link to government data about average hygienist wages by geographic region. These don't spark exploration of dense plies commercial insight. Introduce content might include evidence about the hidden impact of absenteeism on patient satisfaction. Or maybe testimonials from other dentists? But not about how great dense flies knew Instrument is rather about the process of realizing that absenteeism was costing that dentist more than he ever realized. It would not include a pitch deck about the unique benefits of dense plies instruments. Likewise, it would not include a trade show booth displaying dense plies instruments by product category. These are all leading with the suppliers products and do very little to breakdown the customers a state. Confront Content would be an online pain sizing calculator where a mobilizer could plug in a few attributes about her dental practice. Number of patients, Number of hygienists, average days Absent, Percentage of patients with families, Percentage of hygienist hours that are overtime. Hygienist, cost per hour. Average time to fill the hygienist position. That sizes up the true all in costs of hygienists absenteeism. That makes it real for the mobilizer. Thought bubble. I've got to do something about this problem in my business. Confront Content would not include a standard ROI calculator, which is just the return on buying the supplier stuff, not the return on removing the pain the customer is feeling in his A state. Ultimately, you're trying to create a content path tied directly to your commercial insight. In other words, it leads a mobilizer down a teaching path that breaks down the A toward a B state that that supplier is best positioned to fulfill. Example 2. Xerox. While the dentsply example is hypothetical for teaching purposes, here's an example of content that is real. It's part two of the Xerox story from chapter 5. To set the scene here, recall that Xerox wants to engage mobilizers about student performance. Here's what the spark Introduce, confront model looks like in Xerox 's context, laid on top of a simplified purchase journey. In Xerox 's case, the purchase journey has a few high level steps to it. This should look familiar before the mobilizer or broader buying center ever enters the formal due diligence process. There's a period of passive learning. Then you have a stage of need, awareness and exploration, followed by evaluating solutions and on to purchase. The Xerox team realized that across thousands of potential customers, there will be large audiences in each of these stages. The idea is to create on ramps that spark a mobilizer no matter where she is in the journey to travel down a teaching content path that challenges her mental model. For Xerox, that's sparking content took multiple forms. Provocative data points promoted through social media, where mobilizers are doing that passive learning. A series of e-mail scripts that sales reps could use to promote the research findings on the link between color and student performance. A key to 12 segment micro site with resources and banner displays promoting Xerox 's commercial insight content. Third party affiliates posting comments and blogs about the Xerox K12 color research. And efforts. Because your content is focused on surprising or unexpected aspects of the customer's business, those customers won't naturally be searching on your content keywords. So the key is to find adjacencies between your insight related content keywords and the keywords that you're mobilizers are naturally searching on. For Zerox, that might have meant purchasing search terms like Interactive Classroom, a term that school principals might naturally search on. And linking to content on these surprising link between color and student performance. The idea is to locate mobilizers where they are searching on adjacent terms and spark their exploration of your commercial insight. Take them to your infographic or mention of your insights somewhere in earned media. Once you've sparked A mobilizer into exploring your insight, you can pull her in more deeply with Introduce Content. Xerox 's introduced content included A blog series, a white paper titled Improving Student Performance in Unexpected Ways, and testimonial style videos like It's Euphoria video that depicts educators talking about use of color in the classroom. This content portfolio unpacks the commercial insight by using a combination of evidence that appeals to a mobilizers rational side and narratives from peers that appeal to a mobilizers emotional side. In this case, the power of Xerox 's commercial insight meant it was achieving strong engagement with mobilizers on the Spark and introduce content alone. Leah and her team found they could rely on sales reps and account executives to do the work of Confront Content. It equipped them with extensive sales tools and training to help engage customers and help them understand what they were missing and the pain they were experiencing as a result of a flawed mental model about student performance drivers. By the way, as of the writing of this book, much of this content can still be viewed at www.xerox.com slash K12. Sometimes the strength of a commercial insight will win early engagement between mobilizers and sales reps. Here it'll be about having sales tools that are custom built to confront the commercial insight and how well sales reps use them. At the same time, marketing will need to create Confront Content so mobilizers can engage with the personal ramifications of the commercial insight before they speak with a sales Rep. The disciplines of field marketing, content marketing, product marketing, demand generation and sales OPS slash training all need to work closely together to Co create these CSIC content paths that transition seamlessly into sales conversations. We'll finish this example with a really important lesson, Xerox shared, involving editorial discipline. The Xerox team had to keep a ruthless focus on creating content that tied back to their commercial insight. As will be the case with most suppliers, Xerox had a broad set of people and partners creating and curating content. The tendency will be for that dispersed set of content players to drift into the feed the content beast mentality, leading to creation of content that doesn't build out those clear learning paths. As Justin Doyle, the sales program training manager on the K to 12 team, put it. There were opportunities where we could add more information in our content deliverable set. But we wanted to make sure we had a laser clear message and laser clear offering that got back to how color improves student learning. So it was a ruthless editing process to say this is the message that we want to go to market with. We made sure we stayed true to that. Example 3. Smart technologies. The growth in digital communications is opening up all kinds of creative surface area for marketing teams to reach their mobilizer target audiences. It's even allowing marketing teams to create powerful content paths from Spark to introduce, to confront within single pieces of marketing content. One of our favorite examples comes from smart technologies. SMART is a leading provider of technology solutions that enable collaboration in schools and workplaces. This supplier is perhaps best known for its Smart Boards, interactive whiteboards that enable people to better collaborate. Jeff Lowe is the CEO of Smart Technologies, based in Calgary, Canada. We've long admired the work that Jeff and his team have done with Challenger. In this example, Jeff had recently arrived at Smart Technologies and hoped to embed a commercial insight LED approach to Smart's go to market strategy. To set the context, Jeff and his team began crafting a commercial insight they came to call the Tragedy of Disengagement. The idea is that in business these days, there's a greater need for collaboration across work sites and functions. Yet a growing percentage of employees are working remotely. That's leading to disengagement when those remote employees can't effectively participate in collaborative work. And it's costing employers far more than they realize in productivity, higher talent acquisition costs and opportunity costs of great ideas that never come to fruition. It's a great example of a commercial insight. But Jeff and the team realized they needed to penetrate the 57% arrow because buyers of office equipment were increasingly doing their own research and setting buying criteria around very basic kinds of whiteboards and virtual conferencing capabilities. The content piece that Jeff's team created in partnership with smarts agency Gyro is a brilliant example of an effective content path. It's a video enabled direct Mailer about the size of a CD case. Remember those? So this colorful item lands on your desk via mail, inviting you to discover the power of inspired collaboration, which is itself an intriguing kind of event that can spark exploration. When you open the Mailer, a video plays on a screen about the size of a credit card. The video lays out the Tragedy of Disengagement story in an engaging way, bringing both rational and emotional elements to bear to break down the A. The video goes on to paint a vision of inspired collaboration building up the bee. That's the introduce piece. Then at the end, it asks the viewer how inspired is your collaboration and invites the viewer to take a collaboration appraisal. The viewer can enter a URL into a browser or use an enclosed USB stick to navigate to the appraisal, which is an interactive diagnostic. The viewer can input information about her business and get an assessment, highlighting strengths and gaps with benchmarking against other organizations that look like hers. That's the confront piece. In one fell swoop, Smart has overthrown A mobilizer's mental model by breaking down the A and provided a reason and urgency to take action. Pain of same greater than pain of change. It's a great example of the huge creative surface area that marketers have to mix digital with physical as they go about creating SAIC content paths. This would all be very impressive on its own, but if you think about the data set that SMART is building here, you can appreciate why this single marketing vehicle is so brilliant. Over time, SMART has gathered data from 1500 participating organizations on the INS and outs of their collaborative dynamics. Now SMART can provide more specific confronting insights to particular vertical markets or geographies, making it that much more difficult for competitors to attack this commercial insight space that's SMART has come to own. It's like building a data mode around your commercial insight. Now that's smart. Demand generation and consumption of disruption. At this point, you may be wondering how a content strategy that teaches mobilizers ties into demand generation, lead generation, lead scoring, lead nurturing, marketing automation and all that comes with it. We'll take a deeper dive into this in Chapter 10. That's because it helps to have a working knowledge of the chapters on tailoring and taking control to really appreciate the full set of implications for demand generation. But to give you a preview, one of the biggest implications for demand generation is for marketers to shift lead scoring criteria away from sensing purchase readiness and towards sensing mental model disruption. By focusing lead scoring on indicators of purchase readiness, marketers are in essence handing over to sales customers who haven't necessarily had their mental models overturned. They are more likely to be the ones who have done the research on their own in the 57% and are narrowing to the three suppliers they are going to pit against one another on price. The activities covered in chapters 345 and six so far have all covered the Teach part of Teach Taylor and Take Control. Commercial organizations that excel at teach successfully creating commercial insight and then laying down ISIC content paths with demand generation efforts oriented to those paths, we'll have attracted and activated mobilizers engaging them in a conversation they find compelling enough to want to act on. In other words, you'll have covered the ground from phase one to phase two in the simple purchase model from Chapter one. Chapter Seven is all about tailoring. This is where we start to transition from winning the individual to winning the group. Again, sales and marketing will both have important roles to play here, all with the ultimate goal of generating high quality deals.\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Score: 0.03306011110544205\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Content: social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Score: 0.03306011110544205\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Content: social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other. To shed light on just how poorly suppliers Old World Commercial Approach is designed to solve for customers New World Buying dysfunction, let's take a closer look at what these buying groups are struggling\n",

      "Title: Making Collective Learning Happen\n",
      "Score: 0.7986147\n",
      "Content: Chapter 9. Making collective learning happen.  Creating collective learning starts with finding common ground. We'll still run up against a language barrier of sorts, as each function and each silo across an organization speaks its own language, even when they speak the same language. So half the time, different buying groups, stakeholders may want the same thing, but you'd never know it because they're articulating that very similar need in very different ways. We need to find a common language to use in messages that bridges that apparent disconnect. Marketing can attempt to get at this common language through classic customer understanding activities through customer observation and interviews. But we'd like to highlight an elegant and incredibly effective approach that Cisco uses, involving social listening and in market message testing. As we dive into the example, notice how this approach from Cisco is all about identifying shared interests and language, not individual interests and language. We all know Cisco supplier of networking products and services. As Cisco's solutions continue to evolve, they're finding they need to engage and ultimately win over a new diverse set of customer stakeholders. As marketing functions continue to spend more on technology, one of the key new stakeholders is the Chief Marketing Officer. But on the face of it, the views of CMO's diverge from those of Cisco's traditional primary decision maker, the chief information officer or chief technology officer. Superficially, at least, there's little common ground to bring these two groups together on decisions that they eventually have to make together. So Cisco developed a technique to bridge that gap. By listening carefully to social conversations specifically for the building blocks of a common language that might bring these two otherwise disparate groups together, Cisco is able to create messages purposefully built to demonstrate to CMO's and CIO's that they have much more in common. Than they ever realized. If we think about how most B2B commercial teams engage in social listening, it's pretty basic. Typically, we're listening for one of two things. First, we listen for perceptions of us as a supplier. So we scan for mentions of our company or our brand, maybe our products. Second, we listen for common search terms or discussion threads to improve our search optimization efforts. We'll pay some attention to who's saying whatever it is we're listening to, but by and large we're more interested in what's being said. But it's Cisco. It's The Who that matters most. For example, given their new important role in a typical Cisco purchase, Cisco needs to understand CMO's far better than ever before. What are they talking about? How are they thinking about technology? What issues are important? What language is common? To do that, Cisco minds social media and digital publications to isolate content generated by or targeted to CMO's. While not all CMO's may be tweeting and posting, there's a huge amount of content out there produced and published on the things CMO's care about most. Cisco taps into all of it. Content produced by CMO and content produced for CMO's. It's a very targeted search around a single stakeholder, but the key is what they're listening for here. It isn't what CMO's are saying about Cisco. Rather, they want to know what CMO's are saying. Cisco finds that many CMO conversations revolve in some fashion or another around device connectivity. Marketers are talking a lot about what it means to live and work in a world where devices don't just connect with people, but increasingly connect with each other as well. That's important to know because we can use that information in just a bit to build a bridge to IT. Professionals whose Cisco knows through the exact same process are talking about the same thing. But before we build that bridge, we need to find the building blocks for a common language. In addition to finding the topics that matter most, the team then steps back from the terms themselves and analyzes the strings of words around those terms. The goal here is to better understand the broader context within which the topic device connectivity resonates for marketers. That allows Cisco to figure out not just what marketers are talking about, but why those things are important to them. And it's the combination of these two things, what they say and how they say it, that allows the Cisco team to figure out a full range of both issues and language that resonates strongly for a particular stakeholder group. If we stop and think about what they've done here, it's really powerful. This isn't what CMO say about us as a supplier. Rather, it's what they talk about unprompted, when we're not the focus of the conversation. But even more important, it gives us the raw material we need to establish a common ground. Remember, the ultimate goal here is to drive consensus. Cisco can now take that information about how CMO's are talking about device connectivity and map it to how CIO's are talking about device connectivity. Here Cisco is looking for the overlap. In this case, for example, when it came to device connectivity, Cisco found an overlap between CMO's and CIO's around the issue of data volume. More specifically, they found the overlap in the huge untapped potential of all the data out there that could result from a more deeply connected world. This is the conversational overlap Cisco was looking for, which will enable Cisco to help connect these stakeholders together. That overlap can become the basis for messages engineered to speak to both groups simultaneously around an issue they both care about. It would be easy to see five different ways to talk about connectivity. But Cisco sees one because their goal is to build the bridges between stakeholders in the buying group before sales reps ever get in and have a chance to roll up their sleeves. The other piece to this we like is how Cisco then identifies the language that will resonate best with these stakeholder groups simultaneously. In step one, Cisco develops message prototypes. In this case, Cisco seeks to dial up the huge potential for greater connectivity, the common topic we identified from before. Cisco might try messaging like connectivity isn't as high as you think, or only 1% of the world's devices are connected. In Step 2, Cisco tests the messages. It embeds them in social conversations through LinkedIn, Twitter, marketing, technology discussion boards and common blogs. Cisco monitors which messages take off, not just that they get read or retweeted, but that the language in the messages begins to get adopted. Which language gets picked up and used more broadly? Because once Cisco has found those turns of phrase trending across multiple stakeholder groups, then they'll know they have their lingua franca, their common language so necessary for building stakeholder bridges. Those phrases, the ones most widely adopted by diverse target stakeholder audiences, then get built into more formal campaigns, which is Step 3. In this case, the phrasing 99% of the world is still not connected to the Internet is what gets built into larger campaigns. So it's a hugely important process of iterative testing and close observation, but always with an eye toward connecting stakeholders together, not just breaking through to each stakeholder individually. That's because these messages then become the groundwork, the backdrop of the social conversation, as it were, that allows for CIO's and CMOS to find common ground on an issue they may have otherwise never realized they had in common. On the face of it, this Cisco example could feel like rocket science, applicable only in the high tech industry, where there's a rich weave of conversations happening that involve potential customers. But remember, Cisco's approach doesn't just listen for our stakeholders social conversations. It also mines content directed at stakeholders. There's a far larger set of stakeholders from a broader set of industries than just high tech for whom digital content is being created. So at this point, you've identified common ground and common language that can prime disparate stakeholders for consensus. Ideally, that common ground and language are going to be anchored in a commercial insight that reframes the way stakeholders can, as a group, start to think differently about their business. But suppliers don't want to leave this to chance. If you can't have a sales Rep on the ground engaging the stakeholders of that buying center, you want your mobilizers doing that for you. So the other thing we need to do as marketers at this stage is to equip mobilizers to bring those stakeholders together. Equip mobilizers to bring stakeholders together. The key question here is how do we equip mobilizers to persuade other stakeholders? We'll show you how two companies, Marketo and Skill Soft, have done it. Let's start with Marketo. As many readers will know, Marketto plays in the marketing automation space. It's a relatively new technology that allows marketing teams to automate many aspects of demand generation, as well as provide tracking and dashboarding to help optimize those efforts. What's interesting for the mobilizer story is that because this is a technology purchase, there are almost always multiple disparate stakeholders involved beyond marketing itself. You have IT involved. Sales, finance, procurement. So truly a 5.4 kind of situation. Moreover, because this is a new technology, many of those stakeholders don't know that much about it. So their perceptions about the technology are likely to be both off and misaligned. In other words, this is a high degree of difficulty situation for the mobilizer. So if I'm a marketer who wants to mobilize for marketing, automation, technology, I need to engage all of these different stakeholders? How does that go? Well, once I've got my marketing colleagues on board, I might say to the CIO we need a marketing automation system. Typical response. Well, we already have a CRM system that should be configurable to get what you need. We spent a pretty penny on it. As a marketer, you're thinking, no, no, it's not the same. But you don't quite know how best to convey that to a tech leader who talks in, well, techniques. How do I convey to these people that these technologies are different? I might also go to the head of sales, and there you know what you're going to get right? I don't know. It seems like there's five other things we could spend our money on before this marketing automation platform. We've got a long list just to get more mileage out of our CRM investment. And so on. The CFO probably says something similar. That's deflating for a mobilizer to think about these conversations. Some probably give up before they even try to have the conversations. Others may try and get stonewalled or get only so far. So for Marketo, the challenge is how do you get this one mobilizer to go engage and effectively persuade the other 4.4 stakeholders? Again, this is not about getting those stakeholders to connect better to us as a supplier. Rather, it's about getting those stakeholders to connect better to each other. The nice part of Marketo's solution is they've taken something that most commercial teams have already a whole set of sales enablement tools, and with a few simple tweaks, turned it into a powerful set of resources for that mobilizer. Think about that. How many of us have tools we've collectively created in marketing or sales for use by our sales teams or channel partners? Have you got scripting documents and talking points for your sales reps? Objection. Handling Docks, Sales Pitch Decks, ROI, Docs, Stories and anecdotes, Business and use cases. Almost all commercial teams have at least some of these. In effect, Marketo has taken many of these kinds of tools and, with a few minor tweaks, reposition them from sales tools to become tools that help mobilizers go and mobilize. They become customer facing tools. Marketo puts them all online in a resource kit so they're easily accessible for mobilizers. Marketer's toolkit is called The Definitive Guide to Marketing Automation. It's a giant online document on Marketo's website, broken into chapters and downloadable by anybody in return for giving up a little information about yourself. A simple Google search on marketing automation brings it up. Right off the bat, notice that this is not the definitive guide to Marketo. Remember, the peak of group dysfunction and the consensus problem suppliers face happen in just getting a group to agree to the nature of the problem and the solution. Settling on a supplier comes much later. So you need these toolkits to equip that mobilizer to have better conversations about marketing automation, not better conversations about Marketo. This is one area where you'll probably need to tweak your existing sales tools to turn them into mobilizer tools. Because your sales tools were likely created to focus on you as a supplier, you'll need to modify them to focus more broadly on the nature of the problem and solution. For example, the toolkit includes a talking points guide. Marketo has identified what each stakeholder is likely to consider as the alternative to marketing automation as a solution. In other words, what do those stakeholders view as the opportunity cost of your solutions? That's really smart. It gives the mobilizer A glimpse into the kinds of early, very practical objections they are likely to face. In this case, one of the biggest alternative solutions is CRM. Not because CRM and marketing automation do the same thing, but because some of those other stakeholders perceive CRM to do essentially the same thing. Marketo equips mobilizers to have the conversations about the differences and to do so in a way that each stakeholder is going to care about most. Marketo is putting it in the stakeholders language. One tool in the kit is a stakeholder guide. Marketo outlines who the other 4.4 stakeholders are likely to be, what they care about, how they think, how they view the world, the metrics they use to measure their world, and the language they use to talk about their world. It's very similar information to what you'd find in a persona. It's really important because it may not have occurred to your mobilizer that they need to go talk to the head of sales and IT and finance and procurement. Beyond that, Marketo is laying out what the mobilizer needs to say in front of those stakeholders and how to connect the dots between the solution and metrics they use to measure their world. Another tool is an Objection handling guide. Marketo has captured the likely objections the mobilizer will hear from each holder and has provided guidance on overcoming that objection in terms that are going to be meaningful to that stakeholder. As well, what you'll see throughout the toolkit are stories. These are very powerful ways of lighting the path for mobilizers to go out and engage stakeholders. But note that these are not your typical customer stories, which tend to be very supplier specific, highlighting the value the customer got out of working that supplier. Rather, these are about companies that have gone on the marketing automation change journey and what was in it for the company and the mobilizers driving the change. These are absolutely stories that you want to put in the hands of your mobilizers. The other aspect of this Marketo toolkit we like is that it focuses on making it easy for the mobilizer to go and mobilize. Mobilizing a group of disparate stakeholders feels hard and complicated. So the kinds of things they include are ready made business case templates in native PowerPoint format. The mobilizer can download a template, put a logo on it, make edits, add to it. This deck is the skeleton of the conversations that the mobilizer needs to be having. It includes data points, talking points for presentations to different stakeholders and guidance on which slides are key for which stakeholders. Again, it's all about making it as easy as possible for the mobilizer to mobilize. This is how to equip your most important customer, the mobilizer. But remember, you'll need to tweak all of those existing sales tools so they don't come across as supplier centric. If you don't make the toolkit supplier agnostic, you'll risk equipping your mobilizers to be a shill for you as a supplier. That'll undermine their ability to persuade other stakeholders, and it may lead them to not want to mobilize at all. These toolkits should be built in the spirit of creating your commercial insight. Because it's about the customer. It shouldn't lead with you as the supplier, but should lead uniquely back to you. Done well, these mobilizer toolkits can have all the elements of Chapter 6's Spark introduced Confront Content paths embedded in them. Let's take a look at another example of a mobilizer toolkit, this one from Skill Soft. It extends on the marketing idea by centering on a commercial insight, using third party thought leaders in a clever way and layering customer engagement nicely to balance reach and depth of engagement. Skill softs mobilizer toolkit. Skill Soft is a leading provider of cloud based learning solutions, providing its products and services to over 6000 large and small enterprises in the public, private and education sectors around the globe. Skill Soft provides technology enabled learning and talent management programs, platforms and services to help learners build skills and knowledge across a wide range of technical and business subject areas. Pam Boy Rose, VP of Global Corporate Marketing for Skill Soft, saw the Marketo mobilizer toolkit example at CEB's annual Member Summit in Las Vegas, and she immediately knew Skill Soft needed one. As Pam tells it, Skills Soft has 5.7 stakeholders in its typical purchase. As you'd expect, its primary stakeholders are in human resources, or more specifically in the Learning and Development group. But for purchases of technology based learning platforms like Skill Softs, the stakeholder group also includes IT, procurement, finance and legal. Two additional challenges make the consensus purchase dynamic even more challenging for Skill Soft. Cloud based learning solutions are a somewhat new technology, so even skill soft primary stakeholders in HR often aren't deeply familiar with the INS and outs of what they might be buying. On top of that, Pam relates that HR personnel aren't cut in the classic mobilizer mold. Their background, business experience and position in the organization don't naturally put them in a spot to mobilize or be mobilizers. Pam told us a lot of times there won't be a clear cut mobilizer for this kind of learning solution. So our view is we have to make mobilizers. You can download the toolkit from Skill Soft website. It's a great model for other marketers to follow. You will see it feels similar to the Marketo toolkit. It is comprehensive, from educating mobilizers to equipping them to build the business case. It is accessible light on text, heavy on graphics videos and case examples. It makes mobilizing easy. It's loaded with practical guidance and downloadable tools and templates that reduce the effort that goes into mobilizing. But Pam and her team made some key enhancements that are worth calling out. Commercial insight based reframing. Pam and her team used a mythbusting structure to deliver key elements of skill Softs, commercial insights around learning. The simple one page myths with evidence and stories begin to reframe how stakeholders think about learning in their organizations. These are great examples of chapter sixes, spark and introduce content. Thought Leader snapshots. The skill Soft team sprinkled 51 page thought leader snapshots throughout the toolkit. Because these snapshots come from thought leaders outside of Skill Soft and don't endorse Skill Soft directly, they inject a huge dose of credibility to the toolkit. Remember you need these toolkits to help mobilizers, Dr. consensus around the problem and solution, not around a supplier. Pam and her team were surprised at how painless it was to get these thought leaders on board. Her team made it easy for them by drafting the page based on each thought leaders, publicly available research and opinions. Skill Soft approached the thought leaders with the draft and the context on the toolkit. Pam tells us that all five of the thought leaders they approached agreed to have their material included. She says choose thought leaders who are already well aligned to your company, including industry analysts, columnists, influencers and others with name recognition. It's a win win for them as they look to build their personal reach and brand. Layered engagement and support. The toolkit itself is not protected by a download form you have to fill out before you can get to it. Anybody can download it straight from the Skill soft site or forward it to colleagues without filling out a form. But throughout, there are opportunities for the reader to download templates, tools, case studies and white papers. These are gated so Pam and her team can know who is engaging more deeply with the information and tools. The toolkit on its own, even without these downloads, is hugely valuable to a mobilizer. But the downloads blow it out. They give the mobilizer the deep detail and templates that make mobilizing easier. Notice how these downloads are great indicators of where a customer may be on the Spark Introduce Confront Disruption path. Pam's team can tell when a mobilizer has downloaded a detailed case study, which indicates the mobilizer is somewhere in the introduced stage. Or if the mobilizer downloads the RFP template, that mobilizer is well into the confront stage. These are powerful nurture indicators, informing Pan's team and the sales team on how best to engage that prospect next. Putting this toolkit together required Pam, her team and the broader Skill soft organization to think and behave differently, to let go of some firmly held convictions about how marketing and sales should be done. For example, Pam tells us the decision not to gate the toolkit was a big one, and it was hard. Because as a marketer, if you have content that is this great, of course you'd want to gate it so you can know who is engaging with it, right? If a prospect downloads this huge piece of content, it would be crazy not to have that lead go into your system. Let's start nurturing. But the Skill Soft team reasoned that if the primary objective is to equip mobilizers who are themselves trying to drive consensus, then easy sharing was going to be critical. As soon as you put a gate up with a form to fill out, that's a huge speed bump in sharing. Pam told us that it was also tough to stay true to building the toolkit in a vendor neutral way. Every instinct in marketers is to want to paint the picture for how you as a supplier are different. You want to sharpen your value prop. But the Skill Soft team recognized that if the primary objective is to equip mobilizers to drive consensus on the problem and the solution first, then it was going to be critical for the vast majority of the toolkit to be vendor neutral. Lead to, not lead with. That's exactly what the toolkit does. The first time you read about Skill Soft is in the last chapter, page 55 of a 60 page toolkit. Finally, the Skill Soft team faced internal questions about sharing details on the contracting process. Sam at Skill Soft viewed that as secret sauce. Why would you want to equip your buyers with guidance that could help them during contracting when negotiations are starting to take place? Pan's reaction was if we want to equip these mobilizers to help us drive larger deals involving skill softs, full suite of services, they have to know how the contracting works. The only thing that's harder than selling solutions is buying them. The toolkit has been in market for a short time, but already the results are impressive. First off, Pam and the team did a great job of creating a toolkit that is atomize. Table chapters and even pages in the toolkit have great standalone value. The team has been able to seed and repurpose those content atoms in so many different ways. The team is getting extended mileage out of it and it shows signs of having a long shelf life. For example, four months after launching it, Pan's team pulled out an infographic about the top two myths of e-learning and uploaded it to Slide Share. SlideShare chose it as a daily top SlideShare which drove 2000 page views of the infographic within a single week, as well as awareness of the toolkit. In addition, blog posts, social snacks and other smaller derivatives have resulted from the content, and all are designed to drive awareness and downloads of the toolkit. Skill Soft sales Force is loving the toolkit as well. Pam and her team have gotten feedback from sales reps that the toolkit is influencing the shape of RFP's. One account team is using the Business Case section of the guide to chart a path to a larger e-learning solution, increasing an existing customer contract by a factor of 10. Skill Soft and Marketo highlight how a mobilizer can be enabled with great content and tools, whether a salesperson is involved or not. Let's transition into best practices where sellers are creating collective learning moments for their customers with the support of their mobilizers. These sales practices are highly complementary to the marketing best practices just described, and in tandem present a very powerful way to take control of the customer's purchase by encouraging and supporting collective learning. Alpha Companies Stakeholder alignment workshops. Alpha Company has put a lot of thought behind this idea of collective learning and develop some great lessons based on customer workshops. The company's name is a pseudonym is a division of a major financial information company which sells software, data, research and analytical tools for the financial services community. As you can imagine, Alpha has a 5.4 stakeholder story just like everyone else. Even a few years ago, their commercial teams traditionally engaged the Head of the Valuation Desk and his or her immediate team. But over time, because of the scope, complexity and regulatory implications of how financial valuation is conducted. Alpha found themselves speaking to compliance officers, regulators, various C-Suite officers, and, of course, general counsel. Traditionally, the team at Alpha could still effectively build resonance for their solutions with more traditional stakeholders. But as they engage the other 4.4 stakeholders, they found deal support eroding very quickly. They had to find a way to get these diverse stakeholders to recognize and openly discuss disconnects much earlier in the purchase so that the various stakeholders could align around a common problem. This challenge is what led to their best practice, something they call stakeholder alignment workshops. While this is very much a story of winning group consensus, the story starts with the individuals comprising the group. When we asked the team at Alpha how they managed to get customers to agree to attend a workshop in the first place, their answer was you need to do the hard work of getting each individual on board. Not on board with your solution, but on board with the value of sitting down with their colleagues to discuss the potential value of an. Alternate course of action. In other words, they needed to create some buy in for collective learning. The best way to do that, they found, was to highlight the one thing that most sellers try to avoid. The fact that the various stakeholders are not nearly as aligned as they may have thought. Alpha found they needed to run directly at the disconnects among the customer stakeholders. Securing Stakeholder Commitment for a Workshop follows a four step process at Alpha. In the first step, their sales teams lay the groundwork for the workshop. First and foremost, their job here is to listen to the customer and try to get a sense for the goals and priorities of each stakeholder. While Alpha did not necessarily emphasize Reliance for a mobilizer, you can quickly appreciate how useful a mobilizer is to understanding disconnects among the stakeholders in the first place. The idea here is to take those goals and priorities and then point out potential disconnects with colleagues. The alpha sellers are trying to elicit a customer reaction of oh, I'd never thought of that before. Maybe we aren't as aligned as I thought we were. In the second step, Alpha encourages sellers to build some urgency around why the stakeholder disconnects matters so much. The idea here is to paint a picture of what happens if the disconnects go unresolved. At this point, sellers are encouraged to share stories from similar companies where their disconnects were left unresolved and caused all sorts of unforeseen pain, cost and delay. Here, Alpha is trying to get the customer to think we've got to do something about this. This whole effort is going to die on the vine or blow up in a bad way if we don't get on the same page. Once the customer is thinking like that, the seller moves to Step 3. Here a facilitated workshop is offered. Now, this isn't the typical workshop that customers expect from suppliers. Rather, this is positioned purely as an opportunity for the customer to work through their disconnects and reach a state of alignment before they proceed. Alpha sellers carefully position this workshop as a resolution of conflicts and not a demonstration of alpha value. This is all about the customer, not alpha. The goal here is to win each stakeholders commitment to attending a workshop to convince them that a collaborative session isn't just a good idea, it's urgently necessary. There is an important aside related to this third stage. It stems from the old saying in sales, if you're gonna lose, lose early. When we asked the team at Alpha about what happens when customers fail to commit to a workshop, they told us it signals all they need to know about the customers inclination to move forward. In this way, the workshops become an important verifier of customer intent to purchase and a smart way to qualify or disqualify the opportunity. Instead of gearing up for a slow drip loss on a high cost pursuit, Alpha is able to get out early or put the opportunity on hold. Once stakeholders are committed to the workshop, the seller moves to the 4th step. This step is crucial. Here, alpha sellers are encouraged to reach out and prepare each stakeholder for the workshop itself. They are looking to ensure that each stakeholder attends the workshop in the right frame of mind, with the right expectations for an open minded discussion focusing on finding common ground despite differing views. In this step, the alpha seller will attain explicit permission from everyone involved to lay out their different, even conflicting, views in order to seek common agreement. That way, no stakeholder feels blindsided when their views are raised in the workshop. This entire four step conversation is very calculated. This is all about creating momentum, even enthusiasm for a collective learning interaction among stakeholders. When the workshop happens, everyone knows why they are there, what is at stake, and how the event will play out. They have tapped into something the customer wants and then they have very candidly shared with the customer how they are unlikely to achieve that goal unless they resolve their differences. These differences are typically unrecognized by customers and they will get in the way. What Alpha is doing here is forward resolving the change management challenges that the customer will invariably face. As you think about this approach, ask yourself if this looks like the type of conversation that your sellers are having with their customers today. It probably doesn't. In fact, most of our average performers avoid conversations like this. It's messy and tough to navigate. This isn't my problem, it's the customer's problem, they'll say. But this is the crux of the sellers problem. Conversely, when you discuss this approach with high performing sellers, more often than not their reaction is. Yeah, that's similar to what I do too, as most stars have implicitly recognized the need to connect customer stakeholders to one another. So what happens in the workshop itself? Alpha has learned some great lessons that applied to collective learning interaction. Some quick facts about the workshop itself. These are half day workshops typically, though occasionally they will last a full day. On average, five or six customer stakeholders are involved. If there are more, Alpha warns that it can become difficult to manage the conversation and make progress. Alpha has at least two people facilitating the workshop. Typically the seller leads the session and a subject matter expert or a sales manager plays a support role. There is good reason to have more than one person run these. It's nearly impossible for one person to facilitate the session, take notes, monitor the customer's reaction, and track progress. Indeed, for a very significant deal or partnership, a senior alpha leader may run point. But generally their salespeople are tasked with running these types of sessions. The typical flow of the workshop follows the prompting and bounding principles we highlighted in the last chapter. This is done through a three-step motion which ensures that a broad but bounded range of issues are addressed and discussed. This motion involves prompting, exploring and ultimately converging. Before any of this starts, however, one of the clear recommendations that the team at Alpha offered is to have the most senior leader from the customer organization set the expectation that conflict and disagreement are acceptable. This is important to ensure that attendees feel like they can offer their views in a safe environment and that disagreement is to be expected, even encouraged. This is a very different expectation than most senior leaders typically set. After the senior leader sets the appropriate expectations, the workshop enters the initial prompting phase and the first thing the alpha seller does is lay out the set of goals that the participants articulated in advance. The idea here is to elicit stakeholders views on those goals and ensure alignment first and foremost on a single goal. As the goal is solidified, the seller then prompts the participants to discuss their challenges and priorities in pursuing the goal. Alpha sellers draw out individual concerns regarding the pursuit of that goal, exposing any unspoken or underappreciated conflicts. For example, perhaps the Head of the Valuation Desk and the Compliance Director disagree about the best way to handle new regulatory requirements. So the alpha seller would encourage input and debate to help the two resolve the discrepancy. While the discrepancy may not get fully resolved, indeed in many cases Alpha leaves with some homework to provide the customer with a recommendation. The point is that the stakeholders leave more aligned and better understanding each other 's perspective. This allows the customer to agree on something greater than the lowest common denominator. So this first motion of the workshop is all about expansion, putting conflicts on the table. The next motion encourages the customer to explore those perspectives in order to identify opportunities to think more collectively. In this second motion, the principle of bounding the conversation starts to enter the picture. Alpha sellers are very careful to ensure the conversation remains bounded by the initially agreed upon goal set at the beginning of the workshop, as well as keeping the customer focused on the challenges that alpha can support. As the group slows their progress in the exploration stage, the alpha seller then guides the group to begin to converge around next steps. In this third motion of the workshop, it's important to note that this is not meant to drive the customer to buy more from Alpha. At least not yet. Instead, in these early stages of the purchase process, Alpha is trying to win broad agreement that a specific challenge is worth addressing in the first place, and that a specific course of action is the best way forward. The goal here is to get the stakeholders normed around a new perspective compared to when they entered the workshop. Clearly there are many different potential paths a workshop like this may go down, and for that reason Alpha takes planning very seriously. They have planning sessions relying upon worksheets to help capture their ideal session plan as well as a contingency plan should the stakeholders take the conversation in an unproductive direction. One of their worksheets acts as the guide for the session. Here, alpha sellers think through the sequence of disconnects to surface for the group. Think of this as the prompting guide. This ensures that the critical conflicts get raised throughout the workshop in a calculated and controlled manner. The second worksheet acts as the bounding guide. It's the contingency plan should the workshop attendees take the conversation into territory where alpha is less able to help. Importantly, the idea here is to note the areas in advance where customers are most likely to deviate from the workshop central objectives and have a plan to get the conversation back on track. Of course, this plan is not comprehensive, but that is not necessary. By thinking through and planning for most of the areas where the conversation may derail, the seller has a good sense for what to watch out for, and generally has some ideas on how to correct course. This planning ensures that bounding of the conversation occurs, but not just any bounding. This is making sure the conversation is managed to places where alpha can help the customer. Alpha also told us about some helpful practical tips for planning. When the stakes are particularly high, their teams will role play the workshop. After all, for a conversation this nuanced, you would not want to be saying any of these things for the first time in front of the customer. Another tip is to be mindful that your customer does not consider these types of services often, yet you sell these types of solutions every day. As a result, your team is arguably in a better position than the customer to anticipate possible conflicts and disconnects. Use that knowledge and bring that experience to bear. It can help stakeholders recognize things they personally failed to consider. Alpha realizes a significant payoff from this practice. Since the entire workshop is predicated on front loading as many concerns as possible, they find that deals that progress through a workshop have much shorter cycle times and therefore lower cost of sale. That's because instead of stakeholder objections occurring throughout the purchase without warning, Alpha works through these objections early. This allows the objections to be collectively handled by the customer stakeholders and also be dealt with in a far more controlled fashion. As Alpha's head of sales strategy and operations Stewart Meade explained to us. Helping customers gain consensus in a managed environment reduces sales cycles and positively influences our commercial opportunity by identifying customer commitment early in the sale. Accordingly, we have also seen a related reduction in sales expense. Improved qualification, shortened deal cycle, and reduced cost of sale are all due to creating collective learning interactions.\n",

      "Content: social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",

      "Content: Chapter 4. Building commercial insight. In working with suppliers around the world to apply commercial insight concepts, the most common questions we hear from marketers are where are we supposed to find this insight in the first place? Where does it come from? For many, it all feels like a big mystery. In working with these organizations, if there were one lesson we'd want to impart more than any other from all of our work, it is You don't find commercial insight, you make it. One doesn't search for commercial insight among reps, customers, subject matter, experts or anyone else. One builds it. To be sure, it's a science with no small element of art mixed in. It can be somewhat messy. It requires multiple inputs, it is unquestionably organic, and it will most certainly require iteration to get it right. Yet creating commercial insight is nonetheless a highly structured, eminently replicable, highly learnable process that follows a set of core principles that can be combined in all sorts of powerful and creative ways. That's good news for it puts suppliers in control of their own destiny. They don't have to wait around for insight to somehow magically fall from the heavens. They can proactively go out and make it, test it, revise it, test it again, broadly deploy it, and ultimately scale it as an organizational capability. All using tools, tactics and frameworks designed to answer one simple but very powerful question. What do our customers fail to fully understand about their business, but should? That's the central question Commercial Insight is trying to address. At its heart, creating commercial insight doesn't require a deeper understanding of how customers see your company. It requires a much deeper understanding of how those customers see their own company. As we saw earlier, the best way to get someone to think differently about you is to first get them to think differently about themselves. So as we work through two real world examples of commercial insight, one from Dentsply and one from Xerox, the manner in which each company answers two key questions about their customers will serve as our central focus. What are our customers thinking? What are they missing? Because as different as these two examples may appear, superficially at their core, they're both built off of the exact same approach, a deep examination of how customers view themselves. To get there, both examples feature a powerful application of the mental model concept. He study, dance, fly. Dentsply International Incorporated is a leading manufacturer and distributor of dental and other consumable health care products. Their broad global product platform helps dental professionals serve patients oral health care for a lifetime, from preventive services to tooth replacement. Dense ply oral health products range from general dental consumables and laboratory products to products supporting the dental specialty markets of orthodontics, endodontics and implants. Dense fly sales reps call on dentists educating them about dense plies wide range of products including the companies latest innovations. Now one can imagine for a dentist, a capital cost like new instruments is a pretty big expense, so it's not something they're looking to change or upgrade very often. While they certainly want to have the best instruments, they also want to get as much use and value out of those instruments for as long as possible as well. So if an instrument isn't broken, then there's no need to replace it. Indeed, from the perspective of the dentist, an instrument is likely the least of their worries. It's something they'd rather not have to think about at all as they go about the day-to-day job of running a successful dental practice. So if you're a dense ply sales Rep, selling new instruments into that kind of environment can be tough. Like so many other suppliers, Dance Plies biggest competitor is the status quo itself. Now, the one thing dentists do worry about, of course, is the success of their dental practice. After all, they're all small business owners, and the health of their business, along with the health of their patients, is largely what's on their mind all the time. Recognizing this, dense ply has found a way to change how dentists think about their business. That leads back to the unique benefits of dense flies product. But the key to that story is something you might not expect, as the story isn't really about Dentsply. In fact, initially the story isn't even about instruments. To show you what we mean, let's go back in time a few years to dense plies, launch of a brand new dental instrument, and play things out step by step. A tough sell for a great product. Several years ago, after a great deal of research and development, the dense Ply product development team introduced a truly remarkable new product, a dental instrument designed to be balanced, lightweight, and more ergonomic than anything else available on the market today. Better still, the research and development team had discovered a way to shrink the motor driving that instrument to a sufficiently small size, allowing it to be mounted directly into the handle of the instrument itself. Typically that motor, due to its size, was located outside of the instrument, attached by a long, cumbersome cord. With Dense Flies innovative new technology, however, they were able to offer an instrument that was completely cordless. As you might imagine, there was a great deal of excitement across the team as they geared up to take their new product to market. After all, they now had a lightweight and ergonomically designed handpiece, and it was cordless. This thing couldn't lose. It was the instrument to beat all instruments. After putting the right kinds of patent protection in place to protect from potential fast followers, the Dense Ply team set about building a go to market strategy designed to capitalize on the many unique features and benefits of their brand new instrument. As dense Plies sales reps started talking to potential customers about the new instrument, however, something unexpected started to happen. Everyone loved it, but very few people actually bought it. Try as they might to convince dentists of all the ways the instrument was better, dentsply sales reps struggled mightily to persuade them to make the investment to install the new instrument in their dental practices. At least not nearly in the numbers they'd hoped for, given the step change improvements represented by the instruments new technology. And that was really strange, not to mention deeply frustrating. But even stranger, and more frustrating, was the fact that nearly everyone of those potential customers agreed right up front that the new product was unquestionably better in almost every way possible compared to what they were using already. So clearly the problem wasn't dense flies inability to articulate its features and benefits or convey its utterly new and unique value. Instead, the problem was something else entirely. As much as dentists thought the new instrument was great, they also believed that whatever they were using right now was good enough. Or at least good enough for now. Indeed, a typical dense supply sales conversation might end with the customer saying something like. You're right, it is amazing. Wow. It's even lighter than I thought. I love it. What do you think the first question was? The dentist asked upon seeing the new miracle device? You got it. How much does it cost? When the sales Rep answered that question, the dentist hedged. Tell you what, I don't need any new instruments right now, but why don't you check back in a year or so and I'd love to talk to you about it then. And that's painful. After all, tense plies growth strategy wasn't tied to the promise of customers potentially buying more instruments tomorrow. Their growth strategy was built on dense ply sales reps ability to sell more of them today. Yeah, they just landed in the very conundrum we laid out in chapter one. What do you do when your customer looks you in the eye, stipulates right up front that you're better? And still won't pay you for it. It's an all too common, but nonetheless incredibly tough place to be as there doesn't appear to be any easy or clear solution. After all, a clearer, crisper articulation of the new instruments, features and benefits wouldn't help because customers already agreed to those benefits in the first place. In this case, like in so many others, efforts to create an even better articulation of the instruments potential value would simply provide an ever better solution to the wrong problem. So what was the right problem? Overtime, what Dentsply came to realize was that their biggest obstacle in selling more instruments wasn't how those dentists thought of Dentsply or their instrument. The problem was how those dentists thought about themselves and the dental practices they were running. That was the right problem. Reframing the conversation. Through our consulting team, we were lucky enough to have a front row seat in helping dentsply devise a solution to this challenge. Their solution is absolutely fascinating. They discovered the only way to get dentists to think differently about Dentsply and their new instrument was to first get them to think differently about the economics of the business they were running. While it is true that dentists were very focused on running a successful and profitable dental practice, they were completely unaware of the connection between that goal and the potential value of a lightweight, ergonomically designed and cordless instrument. The connection here isn't necessarily obvious. How would a dense ply help dentists make that connection? By starting with a problem the dentists are all aware of, namely the frustratingly high rates of absenteeism and early retirement among their dental hygienists. In a typical dental office, Hi Janice are the ones tasked with much of the routine day-to-day cleaning of patients teeth and can spend hours at a time, day after day, with their hands held at awkward angles while doing their job. Perhaps not surprisingly, the job often results in very sore wrists and overtime, even chronic carpal tunnel syndrome, forcing many hygienists to take time away from work to recover from the pain of doing the job. In the worst case scenarios, the problem can be so severe it can lead to surgery and early retirement. Beyond the all too real impact on individual hygienist quality of life, however, the issue also impacts dentist ability to operate their practice efficiently. As hygienist health problems can flare up unpredictably, forcing them off the job with very little notice for unforeseeable amounts of time. Yet as common as the problem is, dentists tend not to give the problem a great deal of thought, as it's typically seen as a cost of doing business in the dental industry. It's just the way things are is the most common sentiment among dentists around the world who recognize the issue. Having studied dentist thinking and the potential impact of their new product on this problem, this is where Dense Play found an opportunity. To that end, dense fly sales reps now pick up the conversation with their customers in what some might find a surprising manner by first helping dentists understand that the problem is far worse and far more costly than they ever realized. So a dense pie sales Rep might begin with. I wanted to talk to you today about some findings we've had in our research about the true costs of hygienist absenteeism. We're finding virtually all of the dentists we work with are having the same issue, and I'm guessing you're seeing it too. Now, because Dentsply has done their homework in advance, they know the answer to that question is almost guaranteed to be yes, as virtually every dentist has the same problem. At which point the dense ply Rep might say. You know, we've been looking into this issue in a lot of detail lately, and the thing that surprised us about it is just how expensive the problem is. Have you ever sat down to calculate how much that absenteeism is costing your business? To which the debtors it is more likely than not to reply. I'm not sure what do you mean. Well, let me show you. This is actually kind of scary. The dense fly sales Rep then walks the dentist through a step by step calculation of just how much money the absenteeism problem is costing that particular dental practice. With the dentist input they use that practices actual wages, overtime costs, number of hygienists on staff and absenteeism rates to calculate in the moment the fully loaded costs of the absenteeism problem. It's a powerful exercise, as it's one dentist themselves have likely never done on their own. As the dense ply sales Rep digs deeper into the problem, however, they help the dentist make all sorts of connections to the issue that they wouldn't have necessarily made on their own. There's health care costs, the cost of lost business, the impact on employee morale and engagement, the impact on receptionist having to reschedule appointments with disgruntled customers. The frequency with which those disgruntled customers defect to another practice, possibly taking their entire family with them, especially, the research indicates, if they're a mother who takes four to five patients away from the practice. The cost of bad word of mouth. It's a daunting list When it's laid out step by step, with an actual, believable cost associated with each item. The dentist can't help but feel a little overwhelmed by the time the discussion is over. And that's the point. The goal of the Rep here is to demonstrate to the dentist. Empathetically, professionally, Culturally. Correctly, that this problem is far worse and far more expensive than they'd ever realized on their own. All in a highly credible manner, backed by data-driven industry research, practical experience gained from working with hundreds of other similar practices, and the dentist's own numbers. When it's over, the average dentist feels a little sick. Holy mackerel. I knew this was a pain, but I had no idea this was costing me so much money. This is killing my business. Yeah, it's surprising, isn't it? Says the Rep We had no idea the problem was this bad either, until we started digging into the numbers. It's kind of scary. You're right, I have to do something about this. But what can be done? After all, it's just kind of the way this job works. Well, what if there was something you could do about it? The Rep might ask. What do you mean? We've been studying this problem in a lot of depth and one of the surprising things we found is that there might be a solution to this problem. I'd love to hear it if you have one. At this point, the Rep shares with the dentist brand new credible research conducted by third party sources which demonstrates that a large portion of hygienist work related injuries isn't the result of the job itself, but the instruments used by hygienist while they're performing their job. That's a connection that dentists themselves had never made on their own. Partly because the universal nature of the problem had LED them to never investigate the issue in the first place. Partly because all of the instruments heretofore available on the market were similar enough to preclude any possible implications. Again, it was all simply the way things worked. So for dentists to find out that much of this problem is the result of the instruments they choose to put in the hands of their hygienist is a bit of a head snapping moment. It's the instruments. Yeah, it turns out it's the instruments that are causing this problem. Wow, but what exactly about the instruments? It's a number of things. It's their overall weight and their shape. They're not designed to get after this particular problem. They're great for cleaning teeth, but now we realize at considerable expense in the process. Not just to your people, the Rep says, pointing down to the calculation still lying on the table between them, but to your business as well. So you're telling me if I think differently about my instruments, I can make some of this problem go away? That's what we're finding, but the instruments have to be specially designed to alleviate the problem. What do you mean? First of all, they're going to need to be a lot lighter. Much of the problem is fighting the weight of the thing all day long. It doesn't seem like a lot, but over the course of hours and days, it adds up. Makes sense? Second is the shape. No matter how light the instrument, if you're forced to hold the instrument at a bad angle, straining your wrist, the damage is potentially just as bad. OK. But there's something else too, something that surprised us when we looked into this. The real culprit is the cord. The cord. Yeah, that thing weighs more than you might think. When you spend your entire day bearing the weight of that cord to keep your elbow at just the right angle, the impact on muscle fatigue is dramatic. Wait a minute. So you're saying if I want to find a way to solve this problem, glancing again at the cost calculation still lying on the table? Then I've got to have an instrument that's lighter, more ergonomic and what cordless. Where am I going to find an instrument like that? Well, let me introduce you to dense plies new line of instruments. We're excited about them because they were specifically designed to solve this very problem. And scene. And this is how Dense Ply is sells its new instrument today. Now, to be sure, we've glossed a number of areas in the conversation. And added a bit of extra flair for dramatic effect. But by and large, that is the flow of a typical sales conversation today as dense ply sells its new instrument. You'll notice it's very different in a number of important ways. First and foremost, the conversation isn't about Dentsply at all. It's about dentists and their practice. More specifically, it's about a very real problem that they never knew that they had. Or, to be more accurate, it's about a problem they knew they had but never appreciated in terms of its cost and impact. So where does the story of dense Plies new instrument come into the conversation? Not at the beginning, but at the very end. The story doesn't lead with dense ply, it leads to it. That's a key element of any good commercial insight. As we laid out in great detail in the Challenger sale, every good commercial insight conversation follows a very specific path or choreography. This choreography leads the customer to appreciate the supplier's strengths more than they ever would have on their own. That's because the choreograph story is designed to change the way the customer thinks about themselves first, before they're ever asked to consider the supplier. As we like to say, don't lead with what makes you unique. Lead to what makes you unique. The results for dense ply have been dramatic. They're selling more instruments at higher margins in less time than ever before. But to understand the true power of commercial insight, here's a kind of trick question. At the beginning of the story, before Dentsply changed their approach. What were they selling? The answer is they were selling their newly designed instrument. Pretty straightforward. But here's the tricky part. After changing their sales approach, what are dance ply Rep selling? A solution. An idea? A new opportunity to save? All that may be true. But practically speaking, what they're selling at the end of the story is the same thing they were selling at the beginning. It's the exact same instrument. Nothing's changed. They didn't go back to the drawing board to redesign anything. But they're now selling more of that same instrument than ever before at higher margins and in less time. Not because they changed what they sell, but because they changed how they sell it. That's the true power of getting commercial insight right. It doesn't necessarily require a complete revamp of your product portfolio. In fact, it likely doesn't require you to think very differently about your company at all. What it does require, however, is helping customers think differently about their company. And that can come only from a deep understanding of how those customers think of their business in the first place. So with that example in mind, let's turn to that question more systematically now and breakdown the dense supply story in terms of the customer's mental model. It's an instructive exercise, as it's a highly replicable technique any supplier can use for their own customers. Building a mental model. First things first, if we're going to overturn a customer's mental model, then we need to construct that model in the first place. Now, we don't want to put anyone off with the rather academic sounding name mental model, as we think you'll find that this concept is actually pretty straightforward. So what is a mental model? Technically, it's a representation of how someone thinks of their world, ranging from very simple to very complex. But more often than not, we like to draw mental models as root cause diagrams, a simple diagram of cause and effect. To do that, the first thing we need to establish is the customer's goal. What is the customer trying to accomplish? In many cases, the goal will be denominated in some sort of commercial metric, revenue or margin. But it doesn't have to be for marketers. For example, a typical interim goal might be higher Net Promoter Scores. For sales, it might be increased funnel velocity. Of course, for any given customer there are a number of different goals they're seeking to achieve, so picking the right one matters. In the next chapter, we'll show you in more detail how Xerox thought through this very question. But in the case of dense ply, you'll remember that we started with the dentist goal of running a profitable dental practice. Now, once we've established that end goal, we can then work backward from there to identify primary and secondary drivers of that goal and begin to map out their relationships to one another. You'll find this to be a relatively organic process as you gather more information, test which you found, debate its implications, and iterate on your thinking over time. By way of example, let's think through a simple mental model for a typical dentist in our dense ply story. So if we start with a dentist primary goal as running a profitable dental practice, that puts us in a pretty good position to make practical headway. To be sure, dentists have other goals as well, chief among them improving the health and well-being of their patients. But we'll start with profitability here as that outcome best allows us to reverse engineer the story. Indeed, you'll find that different outcomes allow you to engineer different stories. So which outcome is right? As long as it's an outcome that your customer would agree with and has some degree of inherent urgency tied to the customer business, the right one is likely the one that can best be made to lead back to your unique capability. In the case of dense ply, once we've established profitability as the outcome, we can then lay out the primary drivers of running a profitable practice. So there's operating expenses, effective patient care, followed by employee absenteeism, location and others. These models can be built out with almost endless amounts of detail. However, you'll find there are significant diminishing returns after nailing down the top three or four nodes. Once we've done that, we're then set to dive deeper into primary nodes. So if we follow effective patient care for example. What do dentists believe to be the drivers of that? Well, primarily that's likely a result of both staff skill and the instruments they use, and probably a few other things too. If we then go deeper still down the instrument node, we find that instrument quality is thought of by dentist in terms of its durability and performance. So once we've built out the mental model a few layers down, we can then reverse direction and work back up the tree to pressure test the logic and be sure we aren't missing anything important. We can ask things like as a dentist, why do I buy instruments? Well, according to our mental model, I buy instruments that perform well enough and last long enough to ensure that I'm providing effective patient care. Then, at least as far as the instruments are concerned, I can ensure I'm running a profitable dental practice. So as long as I have effective durable instruments, I don't need new instruments. There's the customers logic laid out right there, step by step in a single, simple, easy to read diagram. Think about how useful it is to know that logic if you're in the business of selling dental instruments to dentists. It's like having a map to their mind. It's not Voice of customer, it's Mind of Customer. It's how they think the logic they use when running their business. To be sure, it's a simple diagram, but it's a very powerful one. In terms of the absenteeism node, maybe dentists recognize this driver as an important element of running a profitable dental practice, and maybe not. But either way, they likely wouldn't rank it nearly as important as operating expenses and effective patient care. So why include it at all? Because we'll eventually use that node to teach dentists something they likely underappreciate about practice profitability. So on the absenteeism node, we might include things like staff, health, maybe compensation and office location. Now, if your first reaction when thinking through an exercise like this is how in the world would I construct something like this for one of my customers? We encourage you to give it a try. It doesn't have to be perfect. It's better if your first attempt isn't perfect. That's because the next thing you'll want to do is test it. Put the mental model in front of some of your best sales reps and ask them what they'd add. What would they take away? Where do they think it's wrong based on their experience? Show it to your implementation teams, your product managers. Get their feedback. This is a team exercise, and the broader the input you have, the better. Test it, push it, blow it up and start over. Each change will likely make it better. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be accurate and believable enough for your customers to be able to see themselves in it. Why? Because once you think it's pretty strong, that's exactly what you do next, put it in front of your customers. Find a few whose feedback you trust and ask them. We think this is a pretty accurate view of how you think about your world. Are we close? What would you add? What would you take away? Having made it that far, you can dig in and start exploring the relative importance of different branches. Ask your customers, if I were to give you 100 points to distribute across these top nodes according to relative importance, how would you distribute them? Why that way? What's hard about that exercise? What tradeoffs do you find yourself having to make? It's such a powerful exercise. Even better, practically speaking, conversations like that can be run in person, over the phone, as part of a broader survey via the web built into a customer diagnostic, you name it. But notice, above all else, the essence of this exercise is built around gaining a far better understanding of how customers think of themselves, not how they think of you. Mind of customer, not voice of customer. In terms of the A to B model we introduced in chapter 3, this is a map of the customers A. It's a map of how they currently think their world works. It is the most important building block of commercial insight. As you'll remember, the fundamental movement of any good commercial insight is breaking down the A before building up the B. And this is the a we need to break down. So what do you do with a mental model once you have it? You break it. Breaking a mental model? Without retelling the entire story, let's use the mental model we just constructed to review how Dentsply teaches the customer a completely different way to think about their business. This is the art of unteaching. You will remember the first part of the dense ply story is about building out the total, often hidden cost of hygienist absenteeism. In terms of our mental model, what they're doing here is dramatically increasing the size of that particular box or node. That is, they're teaching dentists that the problem of hygienist absenteeism cost them a lot more than they ever realized. By demonstrating how absenteeism impacts the dentists overall profitability dentsply significantly elevates the importance of this box in the mind of the dentist. The next step is associating that absenteeism with hygienist health. Something we glossed over in the customer conversation earlier, but nonetheless vitally important to the chain of lot. The dense PLY Rep provides data demonstrating that the number one driver of absenteeism by far is wrist pain and not, say, poor work life balance. However, in the case of the dense ply story, this particular step is largely A relatively easy one for most dentists to follow, as they're likely already aware of this particular relationship. The burden of proof on this particular point isn't particularly high. So this is a step that Dentsply can move through relatively quickly with very little objection. Importantly, however, that's a question you'll have to examine carefully for each step in your own story. What's the burden of proof? The higher it is, the more evidence you'll need to move your customer through that part of the narrative. For Dentsply, it's the next step that's the game changer. The truly surprising part of dense plies story for most dentists is the unexpected evidence that hygienists, sore wrists and carpal tunnel is not an unavoidable consequence of having their hands awkwardly poking in people's mouths all day long, but instead a largely preventable consequence. Of the instruments hygienists have in their hands at that time. For most dentists, this is a head snapping moment as it's a connection they've never made on their own. As you might imagine, unlike in the previous step of our story, here the burden of proof is relatively high. You might be wondering how dense PLY came up with this connection. The Dense Supply team did a very clever thing. They hired A savvy dentist to help them with developing the strategy from a practice perspective. It's amazing how quickly you can refine and pin down a customer mental model when you have big chunks of uninterrupted time with seasoned customers. Between the dentist, deep understanding of how his peer dentists think and what they take for granted. And having an outside party like CEB there to drive inquiries that test accepted wisdom. Dense ply was able to find the hidden connection between absenteeism and dental instruments. Not surprisingly, then, dense ply has worked to bring the proper evidence to bear to demonstrate this point both credibly and emphatically. For any supplier constructing commercial insight, when the burden of proof is especially high like this, the quality of the evidence matters. Is it data backed? Is it from credible sources? Is it conveyed in a convincing manner with sufficient context to be understandable, believable and shareable? Because what dense ply is doing here is building an entirely new causal connection in the customer's mental model. It's a relationship between instrument quality and staff well-being that dentists themselves had never appreciated or perhaps even recognized. Ensuring that dentists come along on this part of the journey is crucial. Once they've made it that far, Dentsply is finally ready to talk about the nature of the instrument itself. What kind of instrument would you have to have in order to reduce the risks to staff well-being? The answer isn't about durability or performance at all. The two things you'll remember dentists are focused on most when it comes to instrument quality. Instead, it's something else altogether that dentists probably hadn't given much thought to in the past. It's about instrument ergonomics. So dense ply is adding a whole new box or node to the mental model as a key driver of instrument quality, again checking along the way that they've met the burden of proof for that particular point. But when we step back and put it all together, notice where we've just landed. Dense ply can now draw a compelling but completely brand new causal chain across the customer's mental model. A path that, prior to that conversation, wasn't there at all. One ergonomics have a huge impact on instrument quality. Two, in a way that improves employee health. Three, thus reducing absenteeism and for driving potentially dramatic increases in overall long term profitability. Step-by-step, dense Ply has deconstructed the customer's mental model and rebuilt it around a compelling, actionable idea that doesn't just change the way those dentists think of dense plies business, but far more importantly, changes the way they think of their own business. This is how you break down the A before you build up the B. If you were to distill this process into its basic building blocks, you'd find the entire process boils down to three ways to change a mental model. One, you can add a node, meaning you're introducing a root cause driver that the customer previously hadn't known was there. Two, you can increase the importance of a node. You're showing a customer that a root cause node is far more important than they previously believed. Three, you can add a causal link. You're making a connection between different nodes in the mental model that the customer previously believed had no connection to one another. Or, if you're drawing your mental models with boxes and arrows, as we do in even simpler terms, you can one add a box. Two, make a box bigger. Three, add an arrow. This is the power of a mental model. Sure, it's just a diagram, but it's a diagram that holds a huge amount of power as it crystallizes in very simple terms how customers think of themselves. One important piece of advice as you think about your customers mental models. Don't get overly detailed or make the exercise overly complex. It will stunt the entire point of simplifying how they generally view their business and the opportunities you have to upend their thinking. If you're five or six levels away from the outcome, the likelihood of the customer caring is slim to none. The closer to the outcome that you can find disagreement, the more impactful your insight will be. However, be forewarned that such insights will inherently carry a higher burden of proof, requiring very strong evidence. The further away your disagreement rests from the outcome, the lower the burden of proof as well as lower likelihood of the customer truly caring. The sweet spot for insight is typically around one to three levels below the economic outcome. Now you may be wondering how to decide where to apply mental modeling. After all, customers likely have a whole range of potential outcomes they care about. How would you land on the equivalent of running a profitable dental practice in the first place, as opposed to any other outcome that dentists might care about? To answer that question, we'll turn to the Printing Solutions division at zerox.\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Score: 0.03333333507180214\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Content: Chapter One. The dark side of customer consensus.  This is a book of surprises. Chief among them is the surprising decline of historically effective selling strategies that now fail to generate anything near hoped for returns. Despite suppliers improved ability to convey their unique value, there's strong evidence that today's customers are less willing than ever before to actually pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next, best, less expensive alternative is good enough to meet their needs. While today's suppliers may win the battle for awareness, consideration, recommendation and even preference, they still lose when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. As exasperating as it seems, the very solutions most companies develop to escape commoditization have themselves become commoditized in the eyes of their customers. It all leaves commercial leaders wondering, what do we do now? What's left when the classic sales and marketing playbook we've relied on for so many years falls short? It was partly in response to these questions that CEB Sales and Marketing Practice conducted the research that led to the publication of the Challenger sale. An in-depth examination of the sales Rep behavior is most likely to succeed in today's commercial environment. But while the debate raged around us as to whether Challenger was right or wrong, new or old, too controversial or not controversial enough, we were focused on something else entirely. What else is there? In fact, the more research we did, the more insights we uncovered, and the more convinced we became that there was a second part to this story. One potentially more powerful than the first. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. While there are many reasons customers fail to buy, our data shows clearly that the primary culprit is the dramatic increase in both number and diversity of customer stakeholders typically involved in solutions purchases today and more damning, the severe dysfunction that is bred by the ever expanding number of individuals who need to weigh in before a deal is signed. In the end, what has long seemed to salespeople like a well designed strategy to stick it to suppliers or beat them up on price is more often than not a function of a far less sinister but arguably infinitely more intractable problem. The inability of customers, stakeholders themselves, to achieve broad agreement on a common course of action in the first place. Much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. And that's a challenge most sales and marketing strategies fail to solve, as it's a problem they were never designed to address in the first place. In fact, current sales and marketing tactics exacerbate this problem rather than overcome it. Of course, it's hard enough to sell effectively. How exactly are we supposed to help our customers to buy more effectively? Here, the research holds a final, delightful surprise. Just as we learned in our previous work that it is critical to have Challenger sellers, our latest work shows that it is equally, if not more, critical to have Challenger buyers. In a series of quantitative studies, we were able to isolate and study these individuals. These aren't your run-of-the-mill coaches or advocates doling out information to the sales Rep and vocally championing a given supplier with colleagues. These are a special breed of customer stakeholder focused much more on marshalling the internal resources and buy in necessary to compel their colleagues to collectively think and act beyond the status quo irrespective of supplier. As we've studied these individuals in a great deal of depth, what we've found is in a world of diverse and potentially dysfunctional customer stakeholders, it's not just that you challenge, but who you challenge that really matters. To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. These customer challengers exist and can be found, but only if suppliers are looking for them in the first place. Because everything we've learned in all of our research clearly suggests that finding these individuals, winning them over, and then equipping them to win takes a completely different kind of commercial strategy than what's worked so well in the past. Who are these customer challengers? We call them mobilizers, and this is their story.  The problem of one of three. If there is one concern most top of mind among senior sales and marketing leaders around the world, it is the inexorable downward pressure on deal size, margins and growth as they navigate continued uncertain times. While their CEO's mandate a return to double digit growth. Commercial leaders find themselves more frequently than ever before, competing on little else but price. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that traditionally proven strategy is designed to drive that growth No longer work nearly as well as they used to, leaving senior executives to assume they've somehow lost their way, broadly calling for a return back to basics as they exhort their teams to. Recommit to more disciplined execution. However, getting ever better at an approach already proven to fail does little more than demoralize everyone in the face of ever deepening underperformance. As the head of sales and marketing at a global industrial fragrances company recently put it. I just don't understand. We're the leading supplier in our industry. Our products are world class, our brands second to none, and our salespeople are highly skilled. There's not a single deal in our industry where we're not invited to participate. We make it to the table every single time. But even when we do, he went on, we're always one of three suppliers at the table. Despite all of our commercial strength, we end up competing on nothing but price every single time. It's killing our business. Our premium position simply can't sustain that kind of margin erosion. It's an incredibly common, but still maddeningly frustrating scenario. Here's a company that excels across every commercial metric that might matter, but still faces deep commoditization nonetheless. Welcome to what we've come to call the one of three problem, where a supplier commonly wins the battle for customer consideration, even preference, but ends up competing against two others on little but price nevertheless. How to respond? Typically, heads of sales and marketing would tell you if customers fail to fully pay us for all the incremental value we provide, then clearly they must not appreciate all the incremental value we provide. So they direct their teams to sharpen the company's value proposition. They equip reps to more crisply articulate the many ways in which their company can not only meet customers needs, but exceed them. Be carefully redesigned marketing campaigns and sales collateral to better communicate the broad range of their companies best in class, cutting edge solutions and unique ability to provide moments of deep customer delight. And yet in today's world, even when delivered well, most customers reaction to suppliers costly efforts to better articulate their company's value isn't so much wow, we had no idea, but rather something closer akin to yeah, we knew that already. Today's customers will often concede the point right up front. Responding. We totally agree. We think you guys are great, Your solution is by far the best and we'd love to partner with you. Which feels fantastic until they add. In fact, that's why you're one of the three companies we've invited to participate in this bidding process. But as much as we love your solution, this other company solution is good enough and they're a lot cheaper. So if we can get your solution at their price, then we're good to go. And that's painful. Despite suppliers best efforts to better convey their unique value, there is little evidence that today's customers are any more willing to pay for that value even when they perceive it. At least not when they believe the next best alternative to be sufficiently good enough. So a supplier wins in every way possible, raising awareness, consideration, preference, even recommendations, and still loses when it comes to what matters most. Getting paid. This is the core dilemma of selling solutions. Today most suppliers single biggest competitor isn't so much the competition's ability to sell as their own customers willingness to settle. Across the last five years, the CEB team has dug into this challenge with a huge amount of research into both sales and marketing capability and customer buying behavior, seeking to understand what suppliers can do differently going forward to avoid the underperformance of past approaches. What we've learned is fascinating, if not more than a little bit troubling. Much of the problem lies less in a supplier organizations inability to sell effectively and far more in a customer organizations inability to buy effectively. And a very large part of that challenge lies squarely in customers struggle to achieve common agreement across the wide range of stakeholders now typically involved in virtually any solutions purchase. The rise and fall of the 5.4. One might argue that the challenge of customer consensus is nothing new. Indeed, we've been hearing of the problem for years. And of course the economic downturn in 2009 did nothing but exacerbate the problem as increasingly cost conscious and risk averse decision makers balked at making even the smallest decisions on their own. And yet, if we Fast forward to today, the strange thing is while the global economy has significantly rebounded across virtually every metric that might matter, in that same time, the customer consensus challenge has become far worse. In a recent survey of senior sales leaders, we found nearly 80% reported the number of customer stakeholders involved in a typical deal continues to rise. Why? There are all sorts of reasons for the added number of individuals involved in a deal today, but chief among them would be. 1A Sustained and widespread aversion to risk among both individual customer stakeholders and organizations in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. Two, the fact that most solutions today have both a technological component and a higher price tag, necessitating not only the involvement of IT, but additional scrutiny by operations and procurements executives. 3A Greater concern among legal and compliance officers that all corporate initiatives meet tighter regulatory requirements and information protection protocols. Four, governmental regulatory reform, especially in health care, forcing industry wide shifts in how customers operate and buy. Five customers Efforts to expand operations globally, bringing new regional players to the table. Six, the simple fact that most solutions offered by suppliers today are purposefully designed to integrate more customer functions and tasks than ever before in order to provide customers higher impact, better value and improved ease of use. Seven new management styles and organizational structures leading to flatter, more networked organizations that place a premium on more frequent cross silo collaboration. Every one of these trends not only means more people involved in a typical purchase than ever before, but more important, more people across more roles who likely haven't been involved in the past. Of course, none of these trends is likely to reverse itself anytime soon. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible today to get a deal done without accounting for a seemingly vast array of budget owners, influencers and users. Third party consultants, you name it. But as the consensus story continues to evolve, the thing we find most troubling isn't the rise in number of people who have to buy in, but the equally dramatic increase in number of people who have to sign off. So unlike the consensus challenge of 2006, which largely centered around winning over a single senior decision maker and his or her team, today's consensus challenge has evolved into something far more complex. Today, whether suppliers are selling to a customer with 50 or 50,000 people, they rarely find that almost mythical senior decision maker able to individually approve a complex deal on behalf of all of their colleagues. Instead, more often than not, it's purchased by committee. It's collective consensus across a formal or informal group of senior employees, each with the ability to stop a deal if it fails to meet their particular needs or speak to their individual priorities. And that problem, we find, stretches well beyond just larger customers or more strategic accounts. Consensus challenges are just as likely to crop up in small and medium customers, where suppliers have traditionally been able to conduct most business through a single point of contact. As one sales leader in the food and beverage industry jokingly observed, even when we sell to mom and pops, we've got a mom and a pop, and they don't always see eye to eye. Small business isn't exempt from the consensus challenge. In fact, let's put some real numbers against this problem. In a survey of over 3000 stakeholders involved in a typical B2B purchase, we found that customers themselves report an average of 5.4 different people formally involved in a typical purchase decision. That's 5.4 opportunities for someone to say no. And that one simple number raises all sorts of questions for suppliers. Things like, do we even know who those 5.4 people are? For that matter, does our customer even know who those 5.4 people are? Sometimes they're not sure either. What does each of these individuals care about? How does our solution meet their individual needs? How do we win them over? The real trick in this new world of customer consensus is this isn't just 5.4 different people, it's 5.4 different perspectives. 3/4 of customer stakeholders we surveyed told us these 5.4 individuals span a wide variety of roles, teams, functions and geographies. And really this is the true challenge of consensus today. It's not so much that there are more people in a sale that makes things so hard. But that there are so many new perspectives. Every supplier has a version of this exact same story. For example, if you sell an IT solution, almost certainly you've traditionally called on the customers CIO and his or her team. But as most IT solutions today touch other parts of the business or more business decisions than ever before now feature a strong technological component. Now you're just as likely to also sell to CMO's, CEO's, or heads of HR, depending on who's using your system. Additionally, the broader scope and bigger footprint of your solution probably means you're also speaking with the CFO to procurement and maybe to regional presidents. Not to mention a whole range of end users, influencers, third party consultants and even potential partners. And lest we forget Legal, AKA the Sales Prevention Department. Indeed, one head of marketing in the healthcare industry recently told us for us it's not 5.4 people, but 5.4 committees of people. Bottom line, every supplier has their version of the same story, regardless of industry. We used to sell to X and now we sell to XYZ. As well as A, B and sometimes C. And everyone of them is different. Different priorities, different perspectives, different authority, even different levels of knowledge of what the supplier solution actually does in the first place and why that matters. That's the real challenge of customer consensus today. It isn't just a quantity problem. It's a diversity problem. Because when these groups come together to make a decision, almost inevitably it seems, things fall apart. The purchase likelihood drops dramatically as soon as a second decision maker is present. In a survey of 3000 customer stakeholders involved in a B2B purchase, we asked respondents the degree to which they agreed with the statement. We will definitely buy from this supplier in the next six months on a scale from 1:00 to 10:00. We tested other time horizons and got virtually the exact same result. Six months allowed us to capture the largest sample. We then map those responses according to total number of people on the buying team. Our data tells a dramatic story featuring two distinct downward inflection points. The first represents a rapid drop in purchase likelihood just by adding one more person to the purchase decision. So going from one to two people means overall likelihood to buy goes off a Cliff, dropping from 80% to the mid 50s. Indeed, apparently Mom and Pop don't always agree. Then things level off for a bit until we get past person #5. Then there's a second Cliff where likelihood to buy sinks like a stone to a dismal 30%. As a supplier selling to the 5.4, this is a hard graph to look at. From left to right, this is a one way ticket to indecision, with a final stop somewhere squarely in the center of what some sales leaders have come to call the solutions graveyard. From a research perspective, this finding proved hugely important, as it gave us the first indication in all our data that suppliers don't have nearly so much of A selling problem as perhaps they do a buying problem. Brought on largely by the new and wildly diverse cast of characters typically involved today in any Solutions purchase. For suppliers, however, that's a tough finding to digest as it's hard to know how to manage this kind of challenge. After all, customer diversity isn't something suppliers can make go away by telling their customer. Actually, we don't think your legal or procurement teams need to look this one over. For even if that attempt were to succeed in the short run, the long term consequences can be costly. As the chief sales officer at a global manufacturing company recently told us, we actually tried exactly that just last year, and it worked. We successfully cut everyone out of the purchase other than the head of operations and got the deal done in record time. The problem, he went on, was that when we then went to implement what we'd sold, all those people we'd previously caught out realized what was happening and completely overwhelmed the installation with objections and conflicts that we could have handled in advance if we just included them to begin with. In the end, he said, as hard as it may have been, we would have been far better off getting all those individuals on board as part of the purchase process because the bad will we generated as part of a rocky implementation not only undermine this deal, but likely cut us out of future deals for the foreseeable future. It's an incredibly tough thing to find out after it's too late to do anything about it. But it raises the questions If suppliers can't fully or even partially eliminate customer diversity as part of a sale, then how can they at least manage it more effectively? What's the best strategy for selling to increasingly diverse customer buying groups? Track them all down and win them all over. Around the world, the strategy for selling to diverse stakeholders follows the same frustrating reality. It requires a whole lot of work, and it requires a whole lot of time. In fact, most sales professionals agree the battle for customer consensus plays out across 2 dimensions, not just one. The first dimension is a challenge of access, simply winning the right to get in front of all the individuals who matter in the first place. And that's hard. With all those new people involved, the first step is figuring out who they all are in the first place. We encourage sellers to begin with the question, who are our 5.4 for this particular deal? It's a disarmingly simple question, but often surprisingly difficult to answer. In many cases, these aren't just new individuals, but new roles, functions, and maybe even geographies that that supplier has traditionally never called on before. And chances are pretty good that customers, stakeholders exact role in the purchase may be somewhat murky even to themselves. Beyond identifying them, however, is the more difficult task of winning. The right to speak with them, particularly as a seller may have little to no prior experience or existing connections to fall back on even in existing accounts with otherwise long standing relationships. What's worse, from the perspective of that target stakeholder, they may see no especially pressing need to talk to that supplier at all if they fail to see a relationship between their immediate concerns and the suppliers capabilities. Beyond winning access to each of these individuals, however, sellers still face the even greater challenge of winning each of them over ensuring they position their offering as precisely as possible so as to resonate with each stakeholders priorities and needs. And they have to do that 5.4 times, tracking them all down and then winning them all over. Now, one might argue, there's nothing new here. After all, that's nothing more than just plain good selling, same as it's been for years. But the real challenge is this is no longer a single sale, but a serial sale, each one a little different and carefully positioned to each stakeholder. To be sure, it is great selling, but it's great selling times 5.4. Checking off each stakeholder as they go, ensuring they've bought in before they move on to the next one. This one challenge has become the heart and soul of most sales managers checking calls with their team. So who have you called on so far? How did it go? Are they on board? How do you know? OK, who's next? How are you going to get in front of them? How are you going to position things for them? How do you think they'll react? What objections do you think they might have? Insert role play? OK, who's left after that? So reps work from the known to the less known, the familiar to the less familiar, slowly building consensus step by step as they seek to collect a yes from each of those conversations. A tenured sales manager we interviewed memorably compared it to the plate spinning act at the circus. You get the first plate spinning on the stick and then move on to the second. You get the second one spinning and move to the third, but somewhere along the line the first plate has started to wobble, so you have to go back and get it under control as you're simultaneously trying to move on to the 4th. And so it goes across the board, winning one stakeholder at a time. Check, check and check. But the deeper into the 5.4 we go, the harder these conversations become. In an all too common but still deeply painful scenario, the head of sales at a company that sells highly technical instruments for the manufacturing sector told us that his sales reps are almost exclusively trained engineers, which has always made sense in the past as they've traditionally called on engineers inside the customer organization. However, across the last five years, as the scope, impact and expense of their newer solutions have expanded, they can now rarely get a deal done without also speaking with the customer's head of finance. The problem is their reps have never sold to CFO's before and find them completely intimidating, so they avoid calling them altogether. But what do you do when your own Salesforce is literally too scared to call your customer? At first glance it might sound somewhat absurd, but this happens all over the world every single day. This is what happens when sellers move into the world of the 5.4. Sales reps familiar comfort zone of selling doesn't expand nearly as fast as customers required. Consensus zone for buying. Likewise, parallel efforts in marketing don't fare much better. A recent move in B2B marketing towards something known as B2P or business to people marketing arises in part from this exact same trend. There, the thinking goes, even in the world of business to business buying, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And with the rapid increase in both number and diversity of people involved in a typical purchase, suppliers have to understand those people today far better and get in front of them far earlier than ever before, with content and campaigns that will more specifically speak to each of their unique needs and priorities. In many ways, it's the marketing analog to the track them all down and win them all over sales strategy. So not surprisingly then, we've observed a strong and renewed interest among more advanced marketing teams in building ever more accurate customer personas, trying to understand individual buyers and their needs. Simultaneously, we've watched marketing organizations dedicate increasing amounts of time and money to building more targeted content designed to speak to very specific members of the 5.4 about the issues they care about most at each stage of the purchase journey. Given the scope of the challenge, however, these same teams, often made-up of only a handful of people, become easily overwhelmed trying to place highly personalized original content in all the right places at all the right times for all the right people involved in a typical purchase process. Even then, there is often little concrete evidence to show that any of this effort translates into real commercial outcomes, leaving marketers to point to intermediate measures like increased click through rates or more likes on the company Facebook page to justify the added time and expense of their effort. When we put it together, it's no wonder that commercial leaders around the world complain of increased cost of sale, longer cycle times, stall deals and smaller deal sizes. The ongoing battle of tracking down each of the 5.4 and then successfully winning each of them over not only takes a huge amount of time and effort, it's fraught with challenge every step of the way. And it leaves commercial leaders around the world thinking the same thing. As one head of sales and marketing put it to us rather poignantly, there's got to be a better way. All this customer consensus is killing our business. But what could that better answer be? In search of answers. Given this strong pressure on performance, the CEB sales and marketing practice recently set out to study the dynamics of customer consensus in far greater depth than we ever had in the past. At the center of this work was an effort to supplement the vast amount of customer research we'd already conducted in the past with new data aimed at group buying dynamics. And much of that data came from a survey of 1000 people all involved in some fashion in a typical B to B purchase, representing a wide range of both industries and geographies. More than anything else, the survey was designed to shed new light on the complex relationship across group buying behaviors, commercial outcomes, purchase attributes and sales Rep behavior. The story that arose from all that work is fascinating as upon first glance, it is deeply counterintuitive. In fact, when we first ran our analysis, we weren't sure whether we should believe the result. We went back and reran the numbers, remodeled the data, rechecked the sample in an effort to undo a finding that we initially found very difficult to believe. But the findings proved incredibly robust. Though those findings didn't seem to make a lot of sense when we first saw them, as we dug deeper into the data and continued to dissect the challenge it was meant to address, we came to the conclusion that we've been thinking about the consensus problem in exactly the wrong way, the implications for sales and marketing. We're huge. An unexpected finding? To show you what we mean, let's start with a concept we'll call a high quality sale, which serves as the backbone for much of our consensus work. The idea here is suppliers aren't looking to close just any business, they're looking to close good business. So while it is true that suppliers lose to status quo far more often than they'd like, it is equally true that even when they win, they often don't win the way they'd hoped. Perhaps the customer bought a much smaller, good enough version of their solution. Or maybe the customers so completely beat them up on price that the deal came in way below target margins? So technically we might call those deals wins, but they're hollow victories at best. We hear this all the time from commercial leaders. It's not so much the low quantity of deals they're doing that causes the real pain, but the low quality of the deals that are ultimately sold. So when we talk about a high quality sale in our data, what we're trying to capture is the kind of deal where customers buy the bigger solution at a higher margin. In our study, we defined a quality sale as a deal where customers number one did not settle for a less ambitious solution, but number two purchased a premium offering relative to the base offering. We tested for those attributes through a number of different questions across our various survey instruments. So now the question becomes, how does suppliers win that kind of high quality deal, especially in a 5.4 world? Well, let's go back to our strategy for selling to diversity in the first place and see what happens. You'll remember the conventional sales and marketing approach in the 5.4 world is we have to track them all down and then win them all over. When we ran the various commercial activities associated with that approach through our model, we found something rather shocking. When we measured each of those two approaches, IE winning access or tracking them all down and then better individual positioning or winning them all over against the probability of winning a high quality sale, we found that winning access to key stakeholders boosts that probability by a positive 4%. But positioning our offering to resonate more strongly with each stakeholder actually reduces that probability by 4%. Now, what do those numbers mean? Let's take them one at a time. The way to interpret the access number, for example is this. If we were to move from below average performance to above average performance on winning access to each stakeholder across the 5.4, we'd be 4% more likely to close a high quality deal. In other words, access matters. It has a statistically significant impact on driving up deal quality. Though you'd likely agree, it doesn't appear to matter nearly as much as anyone might have thought. After all, a 4% increase doesn't seem to be all that meaningful. That's kind of strange. But even stranger is our finding for Tactic #2. This is about winning over each stakeholder one at a time by connecting our offer as strongly as possible to whatever they care about the most. So we position our offer to meet their needs, emphasizing our ability to address their specific priorities, speak to their individual view of what's important, and connect directly to what they've got to get done, IE their MB, O's, personal projects, etc. And the impact here is actually negative. Now what does that mean? Well, what it means is that the better we get at customizing our offer at the individual level, the less likely we are to close a high quality deal. Effectively personalizing our offer to each stakeholder decreases deal quality, pushing us deeper into the very commodity trap we were hoping to avoid by personalizing in the first place. In fact, when we dig into the data one level deeper, we find that if we move from below average performance to above average performance on personalization, we're 20% more likely to have a negative impact on overall deal quality. In other words, the better one positions the offer to the individual, the more likely there is to be a negative impact on overall deal quality. It doesn't seem to make any sense. We can tell you our first reaction to these results was a whole lot of surprise mixed with more than just a little bit of concern. After all, we're the challenger guys, the group who found that the best reps are defined by their ability to teach, tailor, and take control. And yet this data seems to indicate that tailoring can actually hurt you. So we stared at this for a really long time, trying to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't until we saw the rest of the story, which we'll turn to next, that we figured out what's going on here. And when you see it, you'll find that this result makes a lot of sense. In fact, you'll likely be as surprised as we were that it wasn't more obvious all along. But before we go there, we first offer one crucial note to provide some important context to our earlier work. Rest assured, today is not the day we disavow ourselves of the Challenger findings and apologetically declare that we got it wrong the first time around. As you'll see, as we continue to work through all of our findings in the world of the 5.4, a challenger approach replete with effective tailoring is arguably more important than ever before. That said, at the same time, these findings have also led us to realize that we must be far more precise about what we mean by tailoring and how we go about it, in order not to inadvertently do damage where we sought to do good. For, the data is indeed very clear. Tailoring done the wrong way can have a significantly chilling effect on overall deal quality. Our traditional sales approach of gaining access and then making our pitch 5.4 times is insufficient to drive commercial growth. Yet that's exactly what most sales and marketing organizations are doing right now, all with the very best of intentions of pursuing a commercial strategy that, frankly, at first blush, seems inescapably logical. So what exactly is going on here? Well, remember, all of this research was conducted within a very specific context, not of selling behavior, but of buying behavior. Even more specifically, group buying behavior. Because what we're ultimately trying to figure out isn't how suppliers can sell effectively to individuals, but rather how they can sell more effectively to groups of individuals. And even more important, diverse groups of individuals. What we found is more than anything else, it's the diversity of these groups that makes all the difference. If there is one finding in all of our consensus work that stands above all others, it is that selling to individuals and selling to groups of diverse individuals is not the same thing. But not because the selling is different. Rather, because the buying is different. Solving for the right problem. You'll remember, the core tenet of marketers push toward B2P marketing, including more personalized content and messaging, is the broad recognition that at the end of the day, it's not companies that buy things, but people that do. And if we don't understand and connect to those people better than ever before, we'll fail to win them over. However, based on all of our research, what we've come to conclude is this. While it may be true that even in business settings it's not companies that buy things, but people that do, in today's B to B environment, it is equally true that it's not people that buy things, but groups of them that do. If we don't understand how these groups of people work together, if we sell only at the individual level and not simultaneously at the collective level, there's a good chance we'll miss what has become the most important dynamic in B to B selling today. Finding a way to connect the diverse individuals that comprise a buying group around a higher level vision than where they're most likely to land on their own. Why is that? There's a very good reason and it shows up right in the data. If we map the relationship between stakeholder diversity and something we've come to call stakeholder dysfunction, we find the relationship between the two to be very telling. Let's start with a couple of definitions. First, stakeholder diversity is based on the range of different functions, roles, teams, geographies, and divergent priorities represented across the various stakeholders directly involved in the purchase decision. Stakeholder dysfunction, on the other hand. Captures the degree to which members of that buying group struggle to effectively collaborate across a number of important dimensions. More specifically, for the purposes of this work, stakeholder dysfunction goes up when one's various stakeholders don't have a fair say in Group discussion. Two stakeholders avoid discussions of the most important issues regarding a purchase altogether. Three stakeholders outright disagree with one another multiple times regarding purchase details. These are all things that can be measured quantitatively by asking survey respondents a series of questions regarding how they collaborated with other members of the buying group. And really, this is pretty familiar stuff. If you think about a group purchase you've been involved in recently, you'll undoubtedly see some of your own experience in at least one or two of those attributes. Think for example about the most recent purchase of a new CRM solution in your organization and how that played out. So let's look at the relationship between these two things, diversity and dysfunction. The data is very clear. As stakeholder diversity increases, so does dysfunction. Pretty dramatically, in fact. Or put another way, as the diversity of the various stakeholders that suppliers find themselves selling to continues to expand, they can expect to see an equally dramatic rise in the dysfunction of the groups comprised of those increasingly diverse individuals. This all makes a ton of sense. There are all sorts of reasons why more diverse groups struggle to function effectively. If someone is working with a group of colleagues across their company, all representing different, sometimes even competing, perspectives and priorities, it's almost inevitable that they're going to disagree with at least someone. Not personally, but almost certainly professionally, as everyone is working toward whatever priorities make the most sense for their part of the business. In that environment, there are all sorts of reasons why individuals might fail to connect as that group deliberates. We all have a tendency to think very carefully about the cost benefit, trade-offs of different kinds and levels of group engagement. I don't want to share my opinion or advocate too strongly for my position. It's too hard. They won't get it. It's a lot of work for very little benefit. It's just not worth it. Or perhaps. I won't speak up because I don't wanna look dumb or selfish or too dominant or too weak or sound too much like I'm not a team player. On the other hand, other individuals might push too hard, seeking to win over the group by sheer force of will or rhetoric or even volume, failing to understand the very different perspectives around them. Achieving group consensus in an environment like that can be extremely difficult. Overtime everyone loses patience and maybe even gives up. Actually, when we think of it that way, it's a wonder that groups can agree on anything at all. That said, things don't necessarily have to be this way. When it comes to effectively creating customer consensus, the data provides a ray of hope as well. For just because diversity and dysfunction are highly correlated doesn't mean that they have to always be intertwined. In the end, suppliers may not have an uncontrollable diversity problem so much as they have an addressable dysfunction problem. Unlike customer diversity, which is largely out of suppliers control, customer dysfunction is something they can do something about, but probably not very well given conventional sales and marketing strategy. Because imagine how the track them all down and win them all over approach plays out in this world of high customer dysfunction. It does nothing to solve for the problem because this is a problem it was never designed to solve. Current sales and marketing tactics are designed to do something completely different. They are far more focused on better connecting individual customers, stakeholders to the supplier than they are on better connecting those same individual customer stakeholders to each other.

We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Content: Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to\n",

      "Caption: <em>Sales</em> and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption.

      "Title: Two Types of Tailoring\n",
      "Content: for how to identify and qualify mobilizers more broadly as well as how to adapt our approach to engaging with different flavors of mobilizers all through precise and purposeful tailoring. We've still made it to only phase two of a typical customer purchase process, securing individual willingness to explore alternate course of action. We're still a long way off from an actual closed deal, as we have yet to cross that long second chasm spanning the solutions graveyard of stalled deals resulting from lowest common denominator thinking. So how do we think about tailoring here? Well, let's look at the answer conceptually first and then we'll get after it more practically in our review of Taking Control across the following two chapters.  Tailoring for group consensus.  Having identified someone willing not only to consider an alternate course of action but also to mobilize for that action among their colleagues, we now need to transform that into group consensus. This is a tough road to hoe, moving from me to we. Here we have to bring in other stakeholders and win them over as well. Procurement has to get involved, finance has to approve, legal has to look things over. As we noted in chapter one, This is why the movement from phase two to phase three is so much longer than the move from phase one to phase two. It's exactly here that a supplier organization must modify its approach to tailoring if it's to have any chance at successfully connecting those stakeholders to each other. For, it's safe to say, even for those organizations deeply familiar with our original Challenger work, the most logical approach to winning customers collective buy in would still be some application of the track them all down and win them all over strategy we first saw in Chapter One. So if we think back to our three phase purchase process, imagine identifying each of the 5.4 stakeholders, conducting the necessary due diligence to identify their needs and priorities, carefully constructing an independent mental model for each, and then systematically breaking down each of those models. And building up an alternate view designed to resonate directly with whatever that person cares about most. Essentially, it's breaking down 5.4 A's and building up 5.4 B's, collecting a yes from each stakeholder until everyone is on board, with the required change embedded in that suppliers Commercial insight. Graphically speaking, this process would look like a series of parallel lines from left to right across the purchase process, depicting 5.4 closely related but nonetheless largely independent commercial insight interventions. Now, not only would a process like that be extraordinarily time consuming, it would be incredibly difficult to execute as well as it would require the construction and deconstruction of 5.4 independent mental models in serial fashion. But more to the point, even if an approach like this were practical, notice what would happen as those 5.4 stakeholders came together to consider a collective action. Insofar as the individual bees that they've bought into independently don't fully align, then those stakeholders will naturally downsize that deal until they do. That tells us, even when done well. In other words, a challenger sale based on 5.4 different flavors of the same commercial insight can lead to just as much trouble as a sale based on no insight at all, as either way customers will be forced to do on their own what the supplier failed to do on their behalf. Namely, establish clear alignment across a common BA mutually agreed upon alternate mental model. So what's the alternative? As we'll see in greater detail in Chapter 8, the alternative is to break down the A individually, but then build up the B collectively, effectively tailoring the delivery and consideration of the commercial insight in a manner that not only wins over a mobilizer but anticipates the potential objections. Concerns and alternate perspectives of the other 4.4. So, to be sure, individual stakeholder outreach must necessarily speak to each person's particular views and priorities. But it must be done in a way that simultaneously builds a mutually agreeable common vision and steers that person closer to a view shareable by their 4.4 other colleagues. In the world of the 5.4, tailoring isn't only about helping stakeholders see themselves in the suppliers insight, but just as importantly about helping them see each other. It's about creating convergence. Despite stakeholders inevitable differences, suppliers must find a way to help members of the 5.4 converge on the same mental model. A mental model that leads them to collectively value the kind of support available only through that supplier sustainably unique strengths. Just to bring us full circle, This is why we find commercial insights so powerful. For it allows the supplier to create that kind of convergence not just around supplier selection, but insofar as commercial insight teaches customers to address a problem or pursue an opportunity that they otherwise didn't realize they had. Also around solution identification and even problem definition. Commercial insight, in other words, initiates customer contact at the very beginning of the purchase process. Or put another way. Done well, Commercial Insight has the power to initiate a new purchase process altogether, leading customers collectively on a journey across the Me to WE mountain. But only when that commercial insight is tailored to create convergence from the very beginning. That said, Commercial Insight cannot carry the day for convergence on its own. Creating that kind of customer connection will take a significant amount of work on the part of the supplier well beyond building and deploying well tailored commercial insight itself. In fact, our research has uncovered a way in which suppliers must take control of the customers buying process to ensure not only that the 5.4 can converge around their commercial insight. But also that they will. So that's where we'll turn next.\n",

      "Title: Shifting to a Challenger Commercial Model - Implications and Implementation Lessons\n",
      "Content: social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n",
