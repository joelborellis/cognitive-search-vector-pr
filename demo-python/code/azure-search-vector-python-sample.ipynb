       "'The excerpt presents a comprehensive overview of various Anxiety Disorders as identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses (DMV-5-TV). These disorders share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Generally, they persist beyond developmentally appropriate periods and are persistent, often lasting 6 months or more.\\n\\nFollowing are the disorders and their diagnostics discussed in the excerpt:\\n\\n1. Separation Anxiety Disorder: This refers to developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached. Symptoms often develop in childhood, but can be expressed throughout adulthood. Diagnosis requires the symptoms to be persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\\n\\n2. Selective Mutism: This is characterized by consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where there is an expectation to speak, even though the individual speaks in other situations.\\n\\n3. Specific Phobia: This involves being fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circumscribed objects or situations, with fear, anxiety or avoidance almost always induced by the phobic situation.\\n\\n4. Social Anxiety Disorder: This involves a fear or anxiety about, or avoidance of social interactions and/or situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized.\\n\\n5. Panic Disorder: Here, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his/her behavior due to the panic attacks.\\n\\n6. Agoraphobia: These individuals are fearful and anxious in many different situations involving public spaces, in enclosed places, in lines or crowds, or being outside of the home alone.\\n\\n7. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Key features include persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that the individual finds difficult to control.\\n\\n8. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder: Refers to anxiety due to substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment.\\n\\n9. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: Here anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence of another medical condition.\\n\\nAccording to the manual, anxiety disorders often develop in childhood and tend to persist if not treated. They are more common in girls than boys and can lead to suicidal thoughts or attempts. The most strongly associated disorders with suicidal tendencies include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia.'"

      "Score: 0.88774735\n",
      "Content: Anxiety Disorders  Anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these two states overlap, but they also differ, with fear more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors. Sometimes the level of fear or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently within the anxiety disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental disorders as well.  The anxiety disorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognition. Thus, while the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be differentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are feared or avoided and the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.  Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children (as in separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders typically overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary determination of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by the clinician, taking cultural contextual factors into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in childhood and tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequently in girls than in boys (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder.  The chapter is arranged developmentally, with disorders sequenced according to the typical age at onset. The individual with separation anxiety disorder is fearful or anxious about separation from attachment figures to a degree that is developmentally inappropriate. There is persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and events that could lead to loss of or separation from attachment figures and reluctance to go away from attachment figures, as well as nightmares and physical symptoms of distress. Although the symptoms often develop in childhood, they can be expressed throughout adulthood as well in the absence of a history of childhood separation anxiety disorder.  Selective mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak in social situations in which there is an expectation to speak (e.g., school) even though the individual speaks in other situations. The failure to speak has significant consequences on achievement in academic or occupational settings or otherwise interferes with normal social communication.  Individuals with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circumscribed objects or situations. A specific cognition is not featured in this disorder, as it is in other anxiety disorders. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is almost always immediately induced by the phobic situation, to a degree that is persistent and out of proportion to the actual risk posed. There are various types of specific phobias: animal; natural environment; blood-injection-injury; situational; and other situations.  In social anxiety disorder, the individual is fearful or anxious about or avoidant of social interactions and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. These include social interactions such as meeting unfamiliar people, situations in which the individual may be observed eating or drinking, and situations in which the individual performs in front of others. The cognition is of being negatively evaluated by others, by being embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected, or offending others.  In panic disorder, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his or her behavior in maladaptive ways because of the panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or of unfamiliar locations). Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear or intense discomfort that reach a peak within minutes, accompanied by physical and/or cognitive symptoms. Limited-symptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms. Panic attacks may be expected, such as in response to a typically feared object or situation, or unexpected, meaning that the panic attack occurs for no apparent reason. Panic attacks function as a marker and prognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, course, and comorbidity across an array of disorders, including, but not limited to, anxiety, substance use, depressive, and psychotic disorders. The specifier with panic attacks may therefore be used for panic attacks that occur in the context of any anxiety disorder, as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder).  Individuals with agoraphobia are fearful and anxious in many different situations, and the diagnostic criteria require symptoms in two or more of the following: using public transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed places, standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside of the home alone in other situations. The individual fears these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. These situations consistently induce fear or anxiety and are often avoided or require the presence of a companion.  The key features of generalized anxiety disorder are persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that the individual finds difficult to control. In addition, the individual experiences physical symptoms, including restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge; being easily fatigued; difficulty concentrating or mind going blank; irritability; muscle tension; and sleep disturbance.  Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment. In anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence of another medical condition.  Disorder-specific scales are available to better characterize the severity of each anxiety disorder and to capture change in severity over time. For ease of use, particularly for individuals with more than one anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have the same format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings of behavioral symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and physical symptoms relevant to each disorder.  Individuals with anxiety may be more likely to have suicidal thoughts, attempt suicide, and die by suicide than those without anxiety. Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia have been identified as the anxiety disorders most strongly associated with a transition from suicidal thoughts to suicide attempt.  Separation Anxiety Disorder  Diagnostic Criteria F93.0  A. Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached, as evidenced by at least three of the following:  1. Recurrent  excessive  distress  when  anticipating  or   experiencing  separation  from  home  or  from  major   attachment figures.   2.  Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures or about possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters, or death.  3.  Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having  an accident, becoming ill) that causes separation from a major attachment figure.  4.  Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.  5.  Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.  6.  Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure.  7.  Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.  8.  Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated.   B. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults.  C. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  D. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.  Diagnostic Features  The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected given the individual’s developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience recurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is anticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment figures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts of their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also worry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or having an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major attachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant or refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have    persistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be unable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display clinging behavior, staying close to or shadowing the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with them when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep away from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bedtime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night, they may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sibling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to go on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping in a hotel room away from home or attachment figures). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the individual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other catastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints, nausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and adults.  The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C).  Associated Features  When separated from major attachment figures, children and adults with separation anxiety disorder may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark, muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become homesick and extremely uncomfortable when away from home. Separation anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic difficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, children may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separation. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be described as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may appear dependent and overprotective as parents. Adults with the disorder are likely to text or phone their major attachment figures throughout the day and repeatedly check on their whereabouts. The individual’s excessive demands often become a source of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict within the family.  Prevalence  The 6- to 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder in children is estimated to be approximately 4%. In a community sample of toddlers, separation anxiety disorder appears to be equally represented among girls and boys; however, school-age girls appear to have higher prevalence rates than school-age boys. In adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%. Separation anxiety disorder decreases in prevalence from childhood through adolescence and adulthood. In clinical samples of children, the disorder is equally common in boys and girls in contrast to community samples, where the  219  disorder is more frequent in girls. Reports from children tend to yield higher rates of separation anxiety disorder than parent reports of the child’s symptoms.  For adults, the 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder in the United States ranges from 0.9% to 1.9%. Among adults with separation anxiety disorder, women tend to have higher prevalence rates of the disorder in both clinical and community studies. Across 18 countries, the mean 12-month prevalence in adults is 1.0%, with a range of < 0.1% to 2.7% (e.g., 0.3% in Romania, 2.7% in Colombia). A higher prevalence was observed in women compared with men in this total sample (1.3% compared with 0.8%).  Development and Course  Periods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are part of normal early development and may indicate the development of secure attachment relationships (e.g., around age 1 year, when infants may experience stranger anxiety). Onset of separation anxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during childhood and in adolescence. Across 18 countries, median age at onset reported by adults (age 18 years and older) with the disorder is in late adolescence in high- and upper-middle-income countries and in the mid-20’s in low-and lower-middle-income countries. Most adults report a fluctuating course of the disorder over their lifetime, and they may report some symptoms in childhood.  Typically there are periods of exacerbation and remission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of situations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to college, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However, the majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety disorders over their lifetimes.  The manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger children are more reluctant to go to school or may avoid school altogether. Younger children may not express worries or specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the anxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries emerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mugging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults, separation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances (e.g., moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned about their offspring, spouses, parents, and pets and experience marked discomfort when separated from them. They may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of needing to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other.  Risk and Prognostic Factors  Environmental. Separation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a loss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of schools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that involved periods of separation from attachment figures). Being bullied during childhood has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of separation anxiety disorder. In young adults, other examples of life stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and becoming a parent. A history of parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with separation anxiety disorder in both childhood and adulthood.  Genetic and physiological. There is evidence that separation anxiety disorder may be heritable. Heritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher rates found in girls. Children with separation anxiety disorder display particularly enhanced sensitivity to respiratory stimulation using CO2-enriched air. Separation anxiety disorder  also appears to aggregate in families.  Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues  There are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate separation, so that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and children are avoided in some cultural contexts. For example, there is wide variation across countries and cultural contexts with respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave the parental home. Youth vary in their self-reports of separation anxiety symptoms; for instance, Taiwanese youth endorse higher symptoms of separation anxiety compared with U.S. youth. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high value some cultural communities place on strong interdependence among family members.  Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior  Separation anxiety disorder in children and adolescents may be associated with an increased risk for suicide, although this association is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in other anxiety disorders where there is significant comorbidity. A large twin study showed that being bullied during childhood was a risk factor for suicidal thoughts during young adulthood.  Functional Consequences of Separation Anxiety Disorder  Individuals with separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from home or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not going to camp, having difficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in adults, not leaving the parental home, not traveling long distances without their close attachments, not working outside the home). Symptoms in adults are often debilitating and affect multiple areas of their lives. For example, adults with separation anxiety disorder may deliberately reorganize their work schedules and other activities because of their anxieties about possible separations from close attachment figures; they may often express frustration with the limitations on their lives because of their need to maintain proximity to, or at least virtual contact with, their key attachment figures (e.g., by texting or phoning them repeatedly throughout the day). Separation anxiety disorder is associated with greater reported impairment in individuals from high- and upper-middle-income countries compared with those from low- and lower-middle-income countries.  Differential Diagnosis  Generalized anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety in separation anxiety disorder predominantly concerns real or imagined separation from attachment figures.

      "Summary: The excerpt discusses two main psychological disorders: Agoraphobia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agoraphobia is characterized by an individual employing safety behaviors, such as sitting near exits in crowded or enclosed places. It involves fear, anxiety, or avoidance that do not correspond to the actual danger posed by the situation but are considered disproportionate. The fear or avoidance must be persistent and cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other significant areas of functioning. Associated features include severe forms that can cause individuals to become completely homebound and dependent; depressive symptoms, alcohol, and sedative medication abuse are common. It affects around 1-1.7% of adolescents and adults worldwide. Women are twice as likely as men to experience agoraphobia. \n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic features of Generalized Anxiety Disorder include excessive anxiety and worry about various events or activities, difficulty in controlling the worry, and at least three physical symptoms from a list including restlessness, fatigue, difficulty in concentration, irritability, muscle tension, or disturbed sleep patterns. It is characterized by long duration and high intensity of worry affecting psychosocial functioning. The 12-month prevalence of GAD is 0.9% among adolescents and 2.9% among adults in the U.S. Women and adolescent girls are twice as likely to have GAD than men and boys. It generally begins in childhood but the onset is spread over a broad range, and it tends to have a chronic course.\n",
      "\n",
      "In both cases, the disorders tend to co-occur with other psychological disorders, become more difficult to treat when accompanied by depression, and are associated with risks such as negative temperaments, childhood adversities, genetic and physiological factors, and environmental stressors.\n",
      "Category: Anxiety Disorders\n",
      "Caption: The most frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific<em> phobias, panic</em> disorder, social anxiety disorder),<em> depressive</em> disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and alcohol use disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Anxiety Disorders\n",
      "Summary: This excerpt can be divided into three sections, each dealing with a specific disorder: Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism, and Specific Phobia.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Separation Anxiety Disorder:\n",
      "The excerpt outlines differential diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder from conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, conduct disorder, social anxiety disorder, PTSD, illness anxiety disorder, prolonged grief disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, psychotic disorders and personality disorders. The disorder is distinguished by fears and anxieties associated with real or imagined separation from attachment figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its diagnosis also considers socioeconomic factors, as it is reported to show greater impairment in individuals from high and upper-middle income countries. In terms of comorbidity, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia in children, and in adults, it's commonly comorbid with specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Selective Mutism:\n",
      "The excerpt offers diagnostic criteria and features of selective mutism, a failure to speak in specific social situations despite speaking in other situations. It can result in social impairment and academic or educational impairment. Children with selective mutism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others in social interactions. Associated features may include shyness, fear of social embarrassment, social isolation, withdrawal, clinging, negativism, and tantrums. The condition is more likely to manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults. \n",
      "\n",
      "Differential diagnosis will distinguish selective mutism from other conditions such as a silent period in immigrant children learning a second language, communication disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and social anxiety disorder. Selective mutism can comorbid with other anxiety disorders, most commonly social anxiety disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Specific Phobia:\n",
      "The diagnostic criteria for specific phobia indicate intense fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation, which must be enduring (at least six months), disproportionate to the actual danger, and create significant distress or impairment in functioning. A specific phobia is distinguished from other disorders which may have similar symptoms but are triggered by different objects or situations. It's common for individuals to have multiple specific phobias and avoidance behavior is a key feature of the disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these disorders requires a thoughtful diagnosis that understands the patient's history, symptoms, and their social, cultural, or environmental context for a comprehensive evaluation. These summaries must also consider the potential for comorbidity with other disorders.\n",
      "Category: Anxiety Disorders\n",
      "Caption: 1) separation anxiety disorder: the excerpt outlines differential diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder from conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, conduct disorder, social anxiety disorder, ptsd, illness anxiety disorder, prolonged grief disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, oppositional defiant …\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Anxiety Disorders\n",
      "Summary: The excerpt presents a comprehensive overview of various Anxiety Disorders as identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses (DMV-5-TV). These disorders share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Generally, they persist beyond developmentally appropriate periods and are persistent, often lasting 6 months or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following are the disorders and their diagnostics discussed in the excerpt:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Separation Anxiety Disorder: This refers to developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached. Symptoms often develop in childhood, but can be expressed throughout adulthood. Diagnosis requires the symptoms to be persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Selective Mutism: This is characterized by consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where there is an expectation to speak, even though the individual speaks in other situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Specific Phobia: This involves being fearful or anxious about or avoidant of circumscribed objects or situations, with fear, anxiety or avoidance almost always induced by the phobic situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Social Anxiety Disorder: This involves a fear or anxiety about, or avoidance of social interactions and/or situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Panic Disorder: Here, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about having more panic attacks or changes his/her behavior due to the panic attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Agoraphobia: These individuals are fearful and anxious in many different situations involving public spaces, in enclosed places, in lines or crowds, or being outside of the home alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Key features include persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that the individual finds difficult to control.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder: Refers to anxiety due to substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition: Here anxiety symptoms are the physiological consequence of another medical condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the manual, anxiety disorders often develop in childhood and tend to persist if not treated. They are more common in girls than boys and can lead to suicidal thoughts or attempts. The most strongly associated disorders with suicidal tendencies include panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia.\n",
      "Category: Anxiety Disorders\n",
      "Caption: Anxiety Disorders  Anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat.\n",
