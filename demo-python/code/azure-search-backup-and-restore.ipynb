    "# Azure AI Search backup and restore sample\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to backup and restore a search index and migrate it to another instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only pre-requsitite is that your search index has a `key` field that is `filterable` and `sortable`. If you don't have one, you can create a new field and assign unique values to your search index. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that only fields marked as `retrievable` can be successfully backed up and restored. It's crucial to consider whether or not you want your vector fields to be marked as `retrievable` in your search index. Marking vector fields as `retrievable` will allow you to backup and restore them and use them for any purpose, whereas NOT marking them as `retrievable` will save you storage costs, but the tradeoff is that you will not be able to backup and restore those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please review this sample and follow the instructions provided in this Jupyter Python notebook to backup and restore your Azure AI Search indexes."
