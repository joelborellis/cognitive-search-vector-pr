      "Chapter 10. Shifting to a Challenger commercial model - implications and implementation lessons.  To win today, you need a challenger inside the customer organization. That is the central premise of this entire book. It turns out the far bigger story isn't about suppliers struggle to sell solutions, It's the customers struggle to buy them. Arming mobilizers with world class commercial insights and supporting their efforts to rally consensus for that insight and inherently then for your solution, requires a new go to market strategy. The implications of such a significant shift in commercial strategy are numerous. Sales and marketing must work together, bound by a new common language of disruption. Seller skills, something we covered in depth in the Challenger sale, must be reconsidered. Marketing content must be atomized and lead customers to a clear narrative that discloses what they've gotten wrong. There are likely sales coverage and territory implications for many organizations as more capable sales talent is aligned to prime growth markets. To say this shift happens overnight or even within a single year is not realistic. This shift takes time. It takes coordination among sales, marketing, and product teams. And above all else, it requires strong and continuous senior leadership support. That being said, there are a handful of implications that our research has highlighted as particularly tricky to navigate. What follows is by no means an exhaustive summary of change management paces. Instead, these are a series of implications that many organizations get wrong from the outset. Left untreated, these implications can undermine your organization's efforts to make this shift entirely. We'd even argue that attempting to make this shift without properly accounting for these implications is downright dangerous. So what are these implications? Implication #1 Demand generation. Most marketing teams aim their demand generation efforts at developing leads that are ready to buy. Traditional criteria of balance budget authority, need and timing dominate demand generation efforts. True, while this approach delivers a ready made customer to the sales team, it fails to do so on your terms. This approach does nothing to shape demand and create high quality leads. We call that mobilizing demand and we'll explore it here. Implication #2. Marketing talent. Most marketing teams are disproportionately focusing their skill building in the digital space. While we agree that's necessary to a degree, there are a set of skills related to the consensus purchase that are being overlooked. These skills are the ones that drive a marketer's ability to create and deploy commercial insight. These skills are more important than digital skills because go to market strategy rests upon them. Implication #3. Social selling. While it's clear that sales reps ought to be using social media tools to engage customers, we observe many social selling efforts that amount to little more than broadcasting, or perhaps more accurately, noise. Yet there's a powerful role for social media in the Mobilizer purchase. It centers on challenging mobilizer mental models in social media, where mobilizers increasingly go to learn. We'll explore how marketing and sales need to collaborate to deliver social teaching, not social selling. Implication #4 Managing blockers. Blockers can quickly demoralize your sales teams as they engage in consensus building efforts. Sellers must confidently address blockers and neutralize their influence for high quality consensus to be forged. Far and away the prevailing thought for managing blockers, however, is to ignore them. Rarely do sales methods teach approaches for blocker management. Even rarer are instances where sales managers ask who the blocker for a deal might be and what should be done to minimize their influence. So it should come as no surprise that sellers do the same, hoping the blocker goes away or relinquishes their objections. We'll explore several methods for actively managing blockers in this section. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. The sales process has long centered on providing a clear frame of reference for seller actions, sequenced in order to maximize sales velocity, create a series of stages that dictate sales progress as well as govern next steps with customers. Remember, much of the commoditization pressure suppliers face today isn't the result of customers willingness to settle for good enough. It's their failure to agree on anything more. Today's sales process must better reflect how sellers can enable the right customer purchase behaviors rather than March a deal forward through the suppliers sales stages. Similarly, opportunity planning follows the same logic. Let's dive into these implications. Implication #1 Demand generation. In this section, we'll take a look at how marketing needs to rethink its demand generation system as a result of the insights CEB research has uncovered about the consensus purchase and the role of mobilizers. By demand generation system, we mean the people, process, technology and data that go into lead generation, lead scoring and lead nurturing. Clearly, this is a large and growing area of investment for marketing organizations, and it's a key piece of achieving greater marketing accountability. The stakes for getting this right couldn't be higher. Here's the risk boiled down to its simplest. If marketers rely on a bad go to market strategy to drive what they put into their demand Gen. systems and how they tune those systems out of the other side, they're going to get bad demand demand that leads to low quality commoditized deals as described in chapter one. Unfortunately, as we've researched all that's been written about demand generation in the blogosphere, we believe much of the conventional wisdom is based on an outdated conception of B to be purchasing. Based on the consensus and mobilizer dynamics uncovered by CEB Research, we believe the conventional wisdom is taking marketers in the wrong direction. If you pick up a white paper from most any marketing automation supplier or read A blog post from a content marketing guru, the conventional wisdom goes something like this. It's an increasingly noisy world, so breaking through to B to B buyers is tough. To breakthrough, you need great content. Great content isn't about you, it's about the customer. In fact, it's not about the demo from a graphic customer. For example, CIO's at companies larger than $100 million in revenue. It's about buyer archetypes or personas and their pain points and objectives. Businesses don't make purchase decisions. After all, People do. Personalize your content to these personas. Be present with your content in the spots they frequent. Say smart things so they think of you first when they're ready to evaluate suppliers. Set up your marketing automation to drive engagement with these personas to nurture them. Feed them content that further speaks to those persona pain points and objectives and whatever they need at that stage of the purchased journey. Measure purchase readiness by level of engagement and signals of bands budget authority. Need timing. Pass those nurtured leads to sales foreclosure. High fives all around. Open champagne to celebrate. Sounds great, doesn't it? Much of this wisdom feels so right. How could this possibly be so wrong? By now, having read the preceding chapters, chances are you can point to a few spots where this conventional wisdom might lead marketers astray. There are three main failure points. One conventional wisdom leads us down a path of creating ever more content, and content quantity quickly Trump's content quality. Coupled with the drive to generate leads and outbound marketing efforts, marketers risk turning off customers who are already bombarded with supplier messages. Two, conventional wisdom is mum on the absolute criticality of upending how customers think of their own business, thereby changing the customers direction when they are learning on their own. That means marketers will generate demand that commoditize their own solution. 3. Conventional wisdom is about better connecting individuals in a buying group to you as a supplier, not about connecting them to each other. So marketers will fail to lay the groundwork for the early consensus that needs to happen about the problem and the solution. Forget about the supplier. Let's unpack those in turn. The failures of demand generation. The first failure point is very straightforward. Marketing creates all of that content in its drive to engage, engage and engage. The thinking goes something like. Be present on a regular basis for each of my major personas in all the places they go for information. Since I've got all that content, go ahead and blast it out through e-mail campaigns and other outbound communications. Deep down, marketers know what happens here, right? Customers get turned off as the quality of content inexorably slips when marketing teams face the pressure of creating the quantity of content that conventional wisdom encourages. Customers inherently tune out suppliers, or even worse, they badmouth suppliers in social forums or refused to take visits from suppliers sales reps. We heard the following spooky anecdote from one prominent demand generation leader who heads up regional marketing for a Fortune 100 tech provider. Over an 18 month period, fully 60% of this suppliers opt in. Customer database has opted out. This supplier was no demand Gen. slouch either. They have been a pioneer in demand, Jen. In a crazy, noisy world, something starts to give if we continue to operate by an outbound engagement obsessed demand Gen. model. On the second failure path, the conventional wisdom. Approach will lead to smaller deals at lower margins by delivering what we call established demand. Established demand is the exact opposite of high quality deals that we discussed in Chapter one. Established demand comes from customers who learn on their own norm around minimum thresholds and then invite a supplier in to compete with two other suppliers in the Price based Bake Off. It's the one of three commoditization problem in spades. These are customers who might have read some of your thought leadership as they went about the research process. But they never had their perspective changed about the way their business currently works. So their view of what they need to purchase is established by the time you engage this customer. If you revisit the conventional wisdom, nowhere are we explicitly confronting customer mental models. However, that's what suppliers need to do to knock the commoditization freight train off its tracks. That's the way to change the customer's direction when they wait until they are 57% of the way through their purchase experience before reaching out to a supplier. In the conventional wisdom all marketers are called on to do is create content that speaks to customers known pain points or that demonstrates how smart they are as a supplier. Recall from chapter three, such approaches do not work because they don't change the customers direction. The conventional wisdom encourages that freight train. Vance based lead scoring criteria detect customers who have budget, a clear need and a set timeline for purchase. Leads that show all of these qualities garner more points in marketers, lead scoring systems and get passed to sales. Two main competitors to extract the best price. What sales Rep wants to waste time chasing that opportunity? This is one of the primary reasons our research shows that the highest performing sellers deprioritize marketing qualified leads. Let's touch on the third failure path, which has to do with consensus. The conventional wisdom would have marketers build stronger connections between their companies as suppliers and people in the customer organization. Marketing creates content that is tailored to personas, on the theory that if suppliers can engage those personas more deeply, they can boost customer willingness to buy from them and that will translate into more deals. But by now we know that individual willingness to buy in a consensus purchase means very little. The conventional wisdom largely misses this consensus dynamic. Personalizing messaging and content to such an extreme leads to driving diverse buying group stakeholders further apart. Even in the best case, this approach will lead suppliers to get a collection of individual yeses, but we know that's insufficient too. It's no wonder that based on CEB demand Gen. benchmarking research, only 3% of marketing qualified leads ever convert into deals. And that's on a good day. How many leads never have a chance to progress further because that stakeholder doesn't feel equipped to help Dr. consensus in her organization around the problem or solution, much less the supplier? Based on CEB research, that's likely happening to a large chunk of the 97% of marketing qualified leads that don't ever progress. Many of those prospect nibbles you get on your white papers, webinars, infographics and demand Gen. emails. Those are nibbles from solitary stakeholders making their daily rounds of industry news sites or LinkedIn groups. They engage because you spoke to their pain points, but they don't come away feeling there's any chance to overcome inertia and create consensus in their large organizations. And that's where the lead dies. Don't generate demand. Mobilize demand. To fix these failure points, suppliers need a demand generation system that accounts for the critical role of mobilizers in overcoming group dysfunction and stitching together consensus. It has to be one that accounts for the peak dysfunction of consensus happening 37% of the way through the purchase, long before sales reps meaningfully get involved. Here's what that looks like at a high level. We'll come back to unpack each one of these in more detail, but the themes will be familiar from what you've heard so far. One, create content paths that confront and connect. Recall from earlier chapters, we need Spark, Introduce, Confront Content for several reasons. It attracts the mobilizers we need. It forms the basis for collective learning at its most powerful, and thereby helps Dr. Consensus. The only way to change the customers direction is by changing their mental models, not through thought leadership or content that is useful to target personas. Moreover, if marketing has created those Spark introduced Confront Content paths for mobilizers to encounter and get pulled into, they are mobilizing high quality deals. Marketing is intercepting and changing the direction of mobilizers before any kind of consensus on the nature of the problem or solution is starting to gel in the customer organization. Through Spark, Introduce, Confront content marketing has greatly improved the chances of shaping that early demand to favor the suppliers unique strengths. Two are just lead scoring criteria to reflect confrontation and connection. Marketing should score leads in a way that gauges how much those leads have been disrupted by content and how well these suppliers content has connected buying group stakeholders within the same account to one another. To do that, marketing will need to tag content according to whether it 1 sparks, two introduces or three confronts. See Chapter 6 for more detail. That's well within the capabilities of content management and marketing automation technology today. Marketing will also want to assign more points for engaging multiple customer stakeholders on the same idea. So as marketing automation systems detect individual stakeholders engaging with content that is more disruptive, either introducing or personalizing disruptive ideas, marketing should also program those systems to detect when that stakeholder has shared that content or when peers stakeholders. In the same customer organization, have engaged with the same kinds of disruptive content. That kind of activity will indicate that groundwork is being laid for consensus in the customer organization. Marketing should assign more points to those leads. Clever design of content with sharing and targeted gating built in as in these skill soft mobilizer toolkit enables marketing to do this kind of lead scoring. Think about how powerful it is to know if you've got a prospective customer who is engaging with content that reflects your commercial insight and who is sharing that with other stakeholders. That's the kind of demand our systems should prioritize. See how different that is from typical bat based and engagement based scoring criteria. Instead of assigning points for purchase readiness bands, which tells you how close you are to capturing established demand that leads to commoditization. You are now gauging how disrupted the prospect is. As well, instead of scoring leads on individual engagement, where you assign progressively more points to content that requires more and more time from prospects, you are giving points for multi stakeholder consumption of counterintuitive content no matter what form it takes. Engagement for engagement sake is meaningless. Marketers should focus on spark, introduce, confront engagement that begins to rally the broader set of buying group stakeholders. Modest points for Spark Content, more points for Introduce Content and lots of points for Confront Content. Bonus points when any of this content is shared with or consumed by fellow account level stakeholders. 3 Nurture leads explicitly for commercial insight and collective learning. Now, when you have leads that aren't yet qualified to be passed to sales for closing, you'll know more precisely what to engage them with next. It will be driven by the likely state of mental disruption and stakeholder connectedness at a prospective account. For example, if you've generated a lead in which one stakeholder who has consumed spark and introduced content, and another lead from a stakeholder at the same account who has consumed only spark content, you might want to put confront Content in front of the first stakeholder and invite her to bring in the other stakeholder. Maybe that's a pain calculator or a diagnostic that the stakeholders work on together so they can learn around a common rallying point. Or perhaps this is where you'd suggest a collective learning workshop, bringing in the sales Rep to help execute. This is a very different approach to nurturing. The typical approach is oriented to feeding stakeholders with a predefined string of progressively more engaging content. Too often, engaging here means content that provides more detail and therefore takes more time to consume. They engaged with our infographic. Let's send them a white paper. Or they saw our white paper. Let's invite them to a webinar. Just because a piece of content provides more detail doesn't mean it's done anything at all to further overcome the customer's mental model or lay the groundwork for consensus. Because nurturing paths are built on customers, most common purchase path, one where they learn on their own and commoditize suppliers, marketers may be unwittingly feeding them content that greases the tracks for the commoditization freight train. How to Know if You're Mobilizing Demand? If you've taken these three steps to reorient your demand systems so that it mobilizes demand, what should you expect? How will common demand metrics move? In the following we layout the common demand indicators and how those are likely to change. This is important to understand because you're going to want to set expectations in the broader commercial organization and even the C-Suite on what will happen to demand as you reorient from generation to mobilization. If you're doing this well, overall lead volume may initially dip because you should be producing less content than you're putting into the marketplace. However, that new content will begin to take on a life of its own as it is more likely to get shared and picked up in earned media. Based on our experience working with commercial teams here, this can take upwards of 12 to 18 months, but you'll see lead volume increase. More important, lead quality will improve provided you've redefined lead quality to reflect emerging demand and not establish demand. That's because you've engineered content to attract mobilizers early on, when suppliers still have a chance to shape how the customer defines the problem and nature of the solution. Now, over time, as your improved content finds its way through earned and shared channels into a broader part of the marketplace, you may find that you get inbound inquiries that don't qualify as leads. You can catch the attention of a variety of marketplace actors and industry players, from industry associations to sole proprietors of small businesses to academics. Inquiries will increase because these players want to learn more about what was under that surprising content. But those should not be interpreted as poor leads or included in any kind of lead dashboard. The key metric to pay attention to here is therefore absolute volume of quality leads. Shifting from a generating demand to a mobilizing demand approach should also increase sales generated leads. Marketing should be equipping sales with counterintuitive social sound bites to help reps engage customers early in their passive learning process on LinkedIn and other social communities. See the implication on social selling later in this chapter. Because Spark introduced Confront Content is more likely to catch attention and get shared, it should boost sales reps ability to source leads through their own social networks. Win rates and deal profitability should also increase. You should be able to get ahead of the RFP and influence not just buying criteria, but the minimum thresholds of performance for those criteria. That translates to higher win rate, larger deal size and or larger margins. Based on CEB research and our members experiences, 15 to 20% price premiums are not unusual for demand that is mobilized and carried through to the sales interaction. It's the same effect that John Goetz, the Xerox account executive, described back in Chapter 5 in Using the Color Drive Student Performance Insight. It's as if the door closes, I'm on the inside and everyone else is on the outside. So far so good. Higher volume of quality leads after an initial downtick. Larger deals, better margins, higher close rates. But what about sales cycle time? There are multiple forces driving cycle times in different directions here. It's very likely that prospective customers will encounter that Spark introduced Confront Content earlier in their purchase journey. They may encounter content in a passive learning stage, perhaps in earned media, before they even begin the journey. That can, in a way, start the purchase clock early if you measure cycle time from the first moment that you have a lead through to deal clothes. All else equal, that might extend sales cycle time. On the flip side, there are also forces shortening sales cycle time. By engaging mobilizers early and equipping them with content and tools that they use to drive consensus in the buying group and surface stakeholder objections early, you canmore effectively build Deal momentum, much like Alpha Company accomplished in its Collective Learning workshops from Chapter 9. That will enable those buying groups to agree on more larger problems and more valuable solutions, and more quickly than if you aren't connecting them early to overcome group dysfunction. Soft indicators of success. If you step back to look at the big picture on KPIs, you'll see that motivating this shift in content and demand generation strategy takes some courage. You're likely to face short term pressure on lead, quality and cycle time as you give the marketplace a chance to digest content. It has to work its way through sharing channels. It has to get noticed and picked up in earned media and by influencers. Mobilizers have to encounter that content, share it with fellow stakeholders and rally around it. As we've talked to CEB members who have been on this demand mobilization journey, they shared with us the confidence giving softer indicators that let you know you're on the right track, especially in the face of some dashboard KPI's that may move temporarily in the wrong direction. You can visualize in a demand funnel. In the pre funnel stage, you'll know you're on the right track if you experience these kinds of things. Proprietary term adoption. You'll begin to see terms that you've coined get used in social media or maybe even adopted by the broader marketplace. See the Cisco example from Chapter 9. Third party references earned media outlets, notable bloggers, and other influencers will start to reference your commercial insight. They love surprising or counterintuitive information, after all. Invitations to present your insights. Rather than having to pay for event sponsorships, you'll start to get invited to present on your commercial insight. That's because your content is less likely to be about you as a supplier and more about these surprising things going on in your customers businesses. If you experience any of these kinds of events, you'll know you're on the right track. Likewise, you should start to see the following kinds of soft indicators in the demand funnel itself. Early engagement with new key decision makers. Your content is winning early Salesforce engagement with decision makers, ones that you hadn't engaged before. Recall from chapters 5 and six how Xerox was able to engage with a new set of more senior decision makers outside of IT. Positive sales force sentiment on lead quality. You'll hear instances of very positive feedback from the sales force on the different in kind discussions that they are able to have with marketing sourced leads who are primed by your content to learn more about your commercial insight and how it applies to their business. Instances of getting ahead of the RFP slash. No bid contracts. You'll hear examples from your sales force of content helping to get ahead of the RFP or spark no bid contract situations. Recall from Chapter 9 how Skill Sauce Mobilizer Toolkit is enabling this. When you experience these kinds of events, celebrate them. Share credit liberally with your team and your sales colleagues. If you've done this right, they were your copilots all along in designing a demand mobilization system. Above all, take courage to fight through the tough parts of the journey. Companies who have moved in this direction, like Xerox, Smart Skill Soft and others tell us the prize is worth the fight. Implication #2. Marketing talent. The chief talent question marketing leaders should be interested in is have I got the right marketer talent to thrive in the world of the consensus purchase? CEB has studied this question quantitatively with special focus on marketers abilities to generate and deploy commercial insight. After all, commercial insight is the key to engaging mobilizers early. If you can get that right, you'll have set your commercial organization up for success against the consensus dynamic. Here's the key take away. Commercial insight, skills and knowledge are in short supply. Moreover, it takes a special blend of those skills and knowledge put into the right operating environment to successfully build and deploy commercial insight. In other words, this can't be left to chance or to heroism on the marketing team. Marketing leaders need to step in to engineer the right kinds of working teams and create a particular kind of environment that nurtures commercial insight creation. Now here are the details. To study this, we conducted survey based quantitative research. We surveyed over 580 marketers in different roles and at different levels from 29 different B to B suppliers around the world. In these surveys, we had marketers self assess their performance across a wide range of attributes, skills, attitudes, knowledge, experience and their work environment. We then had the heads of marketing from each of those companies assess each of their survey participants on their ability across four skills we consider crucial to commercial insight creation. Finally, we then use statistical analysis to determine of all the things you could do well as a marketer, what matters most in building and deploying commercial insight. Here's what we found. First, let's look at the four skills we used as a proxy for commercial insight ability. These are the four skills that heads of marketing scored each of their people on. We looked at marketers ability to one generate insight that reshapes how customers think about their business. To understand and articulate their companies differentiated capabilities and benefits. Three, connect those insights about customers back to the suppliers 's unique capabilities. Four, package all of that in compelling messages across a variety of content types, including sales collateral and other sales support. These are the commercial insight indicators or outcomes we studied. In a moment, we'll take a look at the drivers of these indicators. But let's pause on these indicators for a moment. The first observation is on a scale of 1 to 5, marketers are pretty average at these commercial insight indicators as judged by their marketing leaders. Not great, not horrible, just sort of neutral. There is clearly room to run on improving marketers performance on the skills that matter most for commercial insight. One thing worth noting, when we conducted the survey, we specifically asked participating heads of marketing to select only those members of their team who play a role in the creation of content and messaging. So this is an X-ray of the messaging and content engine itself. When you look at the distribution of marketer performance, you'll find that only one out of four marketers averages above a four. Major deals arise from understanding the customers business better than they understand it themselves, At least where your capabilities intersect the customer business. This is a high bar we're talking about here. When we think about the level of skill we need, it's troubling to see how few marketers excel at the skills required to counter customers thinking. It raises an interesting challenge for marketing leaders. How do I get more of my team above that threshold? Can I shift them there, or will I need to hire new people altogether? To answer that question, we need to better understand the drivers of our four commercial insight indicators. We included a wide variety of potential drivers in our survey. What you see are the factors that mattered most in driving marketers commercial insight indicators. They bundle into five statistically significant drivers. Think of these as categories of attributes that naturally move together and drive those four commercial insight indicators. In case you're wondering about the scores, the number represents the increase in score on a 5 point scale that we'd expect to see if we improve performance from below average to above average. So for example Customer native measures 0.21. That means improving from bottom quartile to top quartile performance on customer native attributes would increase a marketers commercial insight performance on a 5 point scale by 0.21 points. Now you're probably wondering, is 0.21 points a lot? Seems kind of small. But when you Add all these scores together, which represents improvement on all these skills, you see a very dramatic impact on overall Commercial Insight performance. If you were to realize the full benefit of each of these scores combined, that would mean moving a marketer from average level of Commercial insight performance to the top 15%. That's a big deal because it means moving into the zone of creating and deploying commercial insight that can lead to a quantum jump in commercial results. Let's unpack what's in each of these scores. To understand what's underneath these findings, we have to transport ourselves into the actual meetings where these teams are trying to generate commercial insight in the first place. They're looking for potential hidden connections in the customers business that customers themselves fail to appreciate. They're hunting for clues to find these connections. They're mapping customer mental models depicting how that customer's business works and how they make money. They're looking for a place in that model where they can tell customers they're wrong. Then they're finding creative ways to spark, introduce and confront customers with those messages at arms length. That's not easy. So what does it take? Well, First things first, let's unpack the first driver, customer native. What this driver captures is a world class marketers ability to truly understand the customer, their motivations, their decisions, how they speak, what they're thinking. For example, within this driver you'll find activities like hypothesized needs. The best commercial insight marketers can anticipate customer needs before the customers themselves. This goes way beyond asking customers what they need or staring at backward looking data about what customers have ordered. This demands a knowledge of customers that lets you hypothesize what they don't yet even realize they need. That's the key to teaching. It's all about finding unrecognized customer needs. That second biggest driver is labeled investigative. This is more about the posture and traits of the folks you want on the Commercial Insight team. Think of this as a detective type of posture. Always asking why? Sorting through mountains of ambiguous information. Testing assumptions. These marketers are looking for clues in their customers business environment, in their own data about customers, in current market trends and especially in unusual customer stories that might normally be dismissed. All with the aim of connecting information in new ways to show customers how their mental models are off base. Also note the not overly confident sub driver under the investigative heading. There's a type of marketer out there who runs against this investigative posture that you definitely do not want on your commercial insight team. That's the overconfident marketer who assumes he already knows what the customer needs and rationalizes away any evidence to the contrary. The third biggest driver is labeled business savvy. This one is really interesting not just for what it is, but also for what it's not. It turns out marketers with a consulting or strategic planning background perform well on our four commercial insight indicators, and people with a deep background in data, slash analytics or creative design don't. Why? Well, the business savvy brings two things to the table. First, these folks are already good at building and tearing down mental models. That's essentially what consulting or strategic planning has trained them to do. Work through complex and ambiguous problems. They live for that. Second, they bring with them an extensive mental library of business and economic frameworks, how money is made and how business models work in a whole range of industries and situations. That's a critical ingredient for landing on commercial insight, finding the hidden connections that aren't just hidden but economically meaningful. Think about dense ply and the modeling of absenteeism cost on the profitability of the dentist practice. Those are the first three sets of drivers. They all fit under a people heading because they're more about the attributes of the individual people who are building and deploying commercial insight. It's a special blend of skills, background and knowledge. The data tells us it's quite likely that you wouldn't find this blend in any single person. That's borne out in our experience working with organizations on commercial insight, too. Building and deploying commercial insight is more of a team sport. Commercial leaders will probably have to look beyond marketing to product strategy, sales insights, maybe even R&D to find the right people mix here. The crucial implication is staffing for commercial insight can't be left to chance. It's not to be taken on by a casual mix of frontline marketers or volunteers. Commercial leaders need to deliberately engineer the right blend of people. Now commercial leaders also need to set the right operating conditions for these people to work in. That's what the last two drivers speak to and why we put them under an environment heading. The first one of these two drivers is Co creative teams. Coming up with commercial insight is an organic, interactive, synthetic exercise. As a result, commercial leaders have to foster an environment where sharing and building on one another's ideas is not just encouraged. But expected. Remember, commercial insight, by definition is disruptive. Some of the best ideas are going to seem pretty far fetched at first glance. They'll run counter. To how customers currently view their world. Under this driver, we observe that the best performing teams have marketing and sales working together on this, collaborating to build on each other 's experience and synthesize different ideas, and willing to accept when their ideas may not win out. Also under this Co creative teams driver, we observed an interesting dynamic about the high performing teams not feeling like it was necessary to take turns to talk. We think this one showed up because commercial organizations often bring together teams that are too large to generate commercial insight. Four to five people is the ideal size. If you've got 7-8 or more, chances are pretty good you've already made some sacrifices on the people's skills and traits we've discussed. Then, whenever you get groups that large, the team feels compelled to include everyone's thinking, and that dilutes your keen insights. It's the one pizza rule. If you have to order two pizzas to feed the team for late night work sessions, the team is too big. The second of the environment drivers is encourage risks. By now, this one should come as no surprise. Generating commercial insight is fundamentally a creative task, and if you don't encourage risk taking, you're not going to get the lateral thinking and outlier ideas that end up being the richest kernels of commercial insight. If you are to get breakthrough commercial insight, this is the kind of people mix and environment you need to engineer as marketing leaders. This responsibility extends to sales and product leaders as well, given the mix of talent that is required to generate commercial insight. Implication #3 Social selling. In chapter five, we focused on using content to challenge mobilizers mental models early. It's absolutely critical for marketing to do this, but that doesn't mean commercial organization should give up on getting sales reps to engage with mobilizers to begin breaking down the A as early as possible. The rise of social media gives occasion for marketing and sales to work together to create these early teaching opportunities. It looks very different from the typical broadcast approach we see commercial organizations taking to do social selling. One of the key questions that our research highlighting that customers are 57% of the way through a purchase surface is if customers are delaying contact with supplier sales reps, how is it that some sales reps are still managing to get in early? What are they doing differently? So we studied sales Rep behavior to find out. That question led us to study sales Rep behavior on engaging customers early, bringing both quantitative and qualitative research methods to bear, and unearthed an important set of insights. We fielded a survey to over 1000 sales reps from 23B to B companies across all kinds of industries. We tested over 90 sales Rep attributes and behaviors, all related to getting in early with customers. Then we conducted over 100 structured interviews with sales reps, managers and leaders, all with an eye to understanding what separates high performers from average performers when it comes to getting in early. The single most powerful behavior separating high performers from core performers is using social media as a critical channel to engage customers and generate leads. What exactly does it mean to use social media in the context of getting in early? Well, when you unpack the data, it comes down to three things. One connecting with potential customers. Two, using social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter to share points of view valuable to customers. Three, using social media for lead generation. When we talked to a number of sales reps having huge success with this approach, what we found is this all adds up to positioning oneself as a key influencer within social networks. To do that, we found the best reps worked very hard to tap into a large social network extending far beyond personal contacts and current customers. These reps are accessing the entire ecosystem of the marketplace that that Rep sells into. So not just existing customers, but potential customers. Even people who might never be your customer, but could potentially buy your product in another territory through a different channel or through another supplier altogether. But that's just the beginning. Then there are channel partners, industry experts, market influencers, complementary suppliers, influencers from similar or adjacent industries, you name it. Basically, it's anyone and everyone who might be interested in engaging in a conversation around the broadest set of issues your products and services potentially touch. So the best reps Find the watering holes or those online communities where people in their industry gather and learn. In advanced cases, the very best reps will serve as teaching connectors, serving as a hub, bringing this group of people together in order to engage in a learning conversation around a common interest. Done well, sales reps who play this role as Teaching Connector are much more likely to attract mobilizers into their orbit. Now there are clearly ways that refuse of social media can go wrong. The best reps who are involved in social media are very careful how they use it. The last thing star performers would do with this powerful network they've tapped into is use it to broadcast messages with no interaction or teaching. In other words, using it purely as an advertising channel. Yet we see far too much of social selling happening in exactly this way. No one has any patience for posts like. Just wanted to let you know our new XP Nine 100 is out next month pre-order today. We've all been on the receiving end of this kind of message on LinkedIn. That's not what this channel is for. Rather, it's about actively engaging in a productive, interesting conversation. Ideally, conversation that teaches. It fits right into the spark introduced Confront model from Chapter 6. Social watering holes are the ideal place to spark a target audience into exploring your ideas by sharing surprising data, insights and provocative viewpoints. Because commercial insights are by definition not about you as a supplier, but about customers, they are much less likely to be rejected on the grounds of being commercially slanted. One star performing sales Rep we talked to in the healthcare space summed it up nicely, she told us. You've got to weave yourself into the knowledge fabric where your customers learn, but you've got to earn that right. You've got to help the customer think differently than they would have otherwise. Now in some industries, there are more social watering holes and opportunities for our customers and ecosystem partners to learn and engage in conversations. There are some regulated spaces like healthcare and financial services where social media growth has been stunted. But we've been consistently surprised at how far and wide social watering holes are extending to some B to B categories where you'd never expect it. Chemistry. Check. Material science? Yep. Auto dealership finance and insurance? Uh-huh. We're seeing leading marketing and sales functions tag team to get this right. Suppliers like IBM, Cisco, National Instruments and others are blazing the trail here. When it comes to social media, marketers complain that it's difficult to scale efforts there because social media is so time and labor intensive. Well, these organizations realize that in sales they have multiple times the people power that marketing can bring to bear. We view this kind of social enablement as a critical part of the larger commercial strategy to teach mobilizers and disrupt their mental models early, ideally when they are passively learning, but certainly before the 57% point when they are picking up the phone to talk to a sales Rep. Teach where and when customers learn. Implication #4 Managing blockers. There are times and situations where a purchase bogs down. Where a stakeholder is so incredibly entrenched in their own views and won't budge. As we covered earlier in this book, we affectionately call these fine folks blockers, though chances are good your sales teams use far more colorful language to describe them. Blockers readily derail consensus building and collective learning efforts, spoiling any chance of a new view emerging. When we've interviewed sellers on how to best engage a blocker, a litany of hilarious responses usually ensued. Get them fired or football tickets or humiliate them are among our favorites. Perhaps there is a time and place for any of those actions, but invariably the number one response we heard is ignore them. For years, the conventional wisdom has been to avoid blockers altogether, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand, hoping they will somehow disappear. However, there is one problem with that strategy. Blockers don't go away or stay on the sidelines. They are present, either knowingly or unknowingly, in virtually every deal. Depending on their influence, blockers have a powerful ability to stall and derail the most promising of deals. Fortunately, across the course of our research, we've identified a number of proven, proactive strategies to address and neutralize deal blockers. As a reminder, a blocker is a customer stakeholder who tries to prevent a supplier from closing a deal, whether because they dislike the supplier, prefer a competing supplier, or want to maintain the status quo. Like the mobilizer, blockers don't fall into any pattern of seniority, buying role or functional role. Unfortunately, they come in all shapes and sizes with different influencing levels. Making matters worse, the blocker isn't necessarily even known to the supplier. They could be known, unknown, or even what we would call stealth blockers. Those who vocalize support to the salesperson but then turn around and torpedo the deal behind the scenes. With the inclusion of one or more blockers in any given deal, a supplier's chances of making a high quality sale decrease by 47%. As you well know, blockers are present in virtually every deal. Therefore logic would say that from the get go for most deals, you have only a 53% chance of making a high quality sale. Scary stuff. As most sales managers will attest, salespeople rarely engage blockers effectively. Most salespeople ignore the blockers who are lying in wait to undermine their deals, hoping that they can rally enough support to overrule a blockers objections. We've observed the best sales managers quite literally forced discussion of blockers amongst their sales teams. These sales managers are taught to ask questions like if I told you we were overlooking a blocker to this deal, who would you guess it would be and why? The wording alone is smart. The question doesn't allow the seller to say that there are no blockers. They can't default to their natural tendency, in other words. Another powerful question used by managers is what types of stakeholders typically block deals like this. A great question for prompting the seller to think about similar deals and where there might be common blocker tendencies. Blockers are tricky stakeholders and they will state objections that they think will align with other stakeholders. Objections as they don't want to be seen as explicitly rocking the boat. This makes it hard to uncover a blocker's true concerns. Good managers will ask more straightforward questions like has the blocker had any negative interactions with us in the past? But he or she will also layer in questions that dig at potential underlying concerns like. How could this purchase make the blockers work more difficult? Finally, good sales managers will commit to a plan for managing the blocker. The goal here is to address the salespersons tendency to delay interactions with blockers. What is our strategy for dealing with the blocker prompts action from the sales team? OK, so how do you manage blockers? The first question sellers should ask themselves is can the blocker be persuaded by the supporters in the stakeholder group? In other words, can social pressure be applied to neutralize the blocker? Can they be influenced by mobilizers and other supporters within the stakeholder group? If the answer is yes, you want to apply social pressure through collective learning. As we discussed in this chapter, collective learning involves the exploration of objections, concerns and uncertainties among stakeholders surfacing disconnects, and competing viewpoints. Each of these actions is designed to get everyone on the same page, including the blocker. You're hoping to turn the blocker into a supporter, or at the very least mitigate or decrease their influence on the collective group. In addition to creating a collective learning interaction, these social pressures can be used to counteract a blocker. Conducting a workshop or other event where stakeholders can exchange views with the blocker. Identifying influencers that the blocker respects and having your mobilizer, broker and interaction. Arming your mobilizer or other influencers with information to convince the blocker to support the deal. Encouraging influencers to share why others are supporting the deal. In our research, we found that collective learning decreases likelihood of encountering a blocker by 20%. Further, there is a 35% increase in the likelihood of making a high quality sale when collective learning occurs within a stakeholder group that has a blocker. That's an extremely significant jump and underscores the importance of collective learning. The reason we try this tactic first is not only is it hugely effective, but also it's the lowest risk of all the tactics. Social pressure doesn't carry terribly high stakes. Sure, the blocker might get annoyed if colleagues want them to stand down, but that's about the worst outcome. What explains this impact? Engaging in collective learning creates a larger proportion of supporters in the stakeholder group, reducing the proportion of both neutrals and blockers, in turn reducing the impact of the remaining blockers. Blockers may still exist despite high collective learning. So if applying social pressure through collective learning does not turn or minimize the influence of the blocker, what do we do next? The second question that the seller should ask themselves is does the blocker seem reasonable and approachable? If yes, then the sellers should attempt to communicate through tailored dialogue to persuade the blocker to allow the deal to move forward. Note that we are not yet at the stage where we want to be making concessions. We will get to that in a moment. Different motivating factors drive different types of blocker behaviors. Some want to avoid change, some want the competition to win the business, and some simply want to see you lose the business. One of the blocker types, the Pro Status Quo Blocker, is best engaged by listening to and empathizing with their concerns regarding change. First, show that you understand their concerns, but also later reinforce the risks of not changing, creating urgency for the offering. You can also offer to connect them to previous or existing customers who had similar concerns. For the pro competitor blocker type, you should engage them in discussing the main motivation for making a purchase in general agnostic of supplier. Then explain how you can help them achieve their goals in a way that other suppliers cannot. For the anti supplier blocker type, you should engage by asking them to lay out their honest thoughts about you as a supplier, no matter how brutal. Acknowledge the truth in their perspective and share how you are committed to addressing and making up for your past mistakes. Take note that direct engagement tactics carry greater risk. The chances of the blocker taking a personal disliking towards you increase, and that's baggage no one wants to carry within a deal. But if social pressure failed to work, you may need to resort to this tactic. So what do you do if your blockers are not reasonable or approachable? Or if your efforts to communicate fall short? At this point, it's now time to think about making a concession. The third question that the sellers should ask as part of the progression is does the blocker have concerns about a specific aspect of the offering? If the answer is yes, consider making a targeted concession. Alter the deal to make it appealing, but not entirely commercially damaging to your organization. Now, concessions are tricky and by no means does this approach provide an exhaustive set of guidance for concessions or negotiation, but we can provide some general guidelines to follow when considering and developing concessions. First, thoroughly plan ahead and identify negotiable and non negotiable aspects of the deal. This knowledge is crucial for how you formulate your concession strategy. Second, take those negotiable aspects and hypothesize which aspects the blocker will react positively to and be more inclined to accept. Third, when developing the concession, you obviously want to concede as little as possible for your own benefit, but furthermore want to ensure that you do not endanger your support from other stakeholders because of a now watered down or no longer worthwhile solution. 4th To the earlier point, you need to get explicit support for this new vision of the deal from our set of supportive stakeholders. 5th Practicing good negotiating hygiene. Secure a guarantee from the blocker and other supporters that the deal will go through based on the new vision, preventing further concessions and further delays. You want to ensure that all the work that went in the concession leads to results, otherwise you have wasted time. And money. Again, you've stepped up the level of risk by altering the deal. It's possible that collateral damage is now done and chances are good that you've had to remove something versus making the deal bigger. Active trade-offs are now being made and that's definitely more risky for your commercial outcomes. If you get to the point where making a concession does not work, you then need to go to the final and last option. Escalate. The question you're sellers should ask themselves at this point is do senior leaders at the customer organization have an interest in this deal closing? If yes, you want to leverage someone more senior than the blocker to help grease the wheels and encourage the blocker to allow the deal to push forward. This is clearly the riskiest option and carries significant political ramifications for the blocker. It may potentially endanger their job or career path. Going over the top of the blocker and escalating is certainly a last resort type of option. To that end, let's take a look at some of the action steps and guidelines for the escalation strategy. First, contact one of the blockers leaders and explain the situation. But pick carefully. You'll want to pick a leader who you think can professionally manage the situation and would be receptive to escalation. Someone who can be trusted with mitigating the potential awkwardness of the situation. Second, ensure the leader understands the blockers motivations. Don't just approach them and say Johnny is not playing nice. You want to avoid making this an attack on the blocker. Provide the leader with a balanced perspective so they can judge and take action accordingly and professionally. Third, and this is contingent on steps one and two, if the blocker continues to stall the deal, you can ask the leader to overrule the blockers influence. Now this has the greatest potential for some scorched earth, and we would certainly view this as a last resort tactic. You obviously have to take into account the blockers influence for future deals and account growth. In parallel with all of those steps, it is paramount that you keep our supporters at the customer organization informed and in the loop to avoid concern around the deal, but also to continue the collective pressure that they might be able to exert on the blocker, either explicitly or implicitly. What happens if this strategy fails? At this point, you then have to seriously consider whether you want to actively pursue this opportunity any longer. Is it worth it? Does it still make business sense? That decision is going to depend on the nuances of your business and the type of deal. But in general, our view is that if a deal gets to this point, it's best to put it on the back burner, passively pursue and focus elsewhere. Just to recap, remember. Blockers cannot and should not be ignored. Their impact is immense and as we state here, blockers reduce the likelihood of making a high quality deal by 47%. Managers play a critical role. They can help lessen the likelihood of a blocker obstructing a deal by forcing sellers to identify blockers and conceive engagement strategies early on. You can minimize a blockers impact and influence, but you can't necessarily eliminate it altogether. Collective learning minimizes A blockers impact, but more aggressive engagement strategies may still be needed. The importance of collective learning can't be understated in today's consensus driven purchase, where divergent views and dysfunction reigns supreme and deals get compressed and compressed to the lowest common denominator. It's the means by which we can help our mobilizers forge a purchase decision. It brings diverse stakeholders, including blockers and procurement, together to make a meaningful decision. Implication #5. Sales Process and Opportunity Planning. Buying made easy. The challenges of today's customer purchase experience have been highlighted throughout this book. If there is one take away you should have from all the research and best practices shared to this point, it's this. Commercial organizations need to place far greater emphasis on supporting the customer's purchase process. One of our all time classic best practices comes from an organization that has done just that and shifted their entire sales process to more of a purchase enablement process. The company is ADP, the global payroll and human Capital Management firm, and this is their buying made easy purchase process. At first glance, ADP's approach might look a lot like your run-of-the-mill sales process. On closer examination, however, you'll realize this is very different. The first thing you'll notice is that ADP doesn't have a sales process at all. This is actually a very structured approach to moving deals through a customers buying process. This is precisely why ADP refers to this approach as buying Made Easy. This entire approach is designed to support the customer through a series of customer outcomes throughout a typical purchase experience. How most companies design A sales process, of course, is by mapping out the activities known to drive commercial success. Sellers are then expected to execute those activities as effectively and efficiently as possible. The idea being that if sellers do these things in this order, the chances of the customer purchasing are maximized. But what ADP is doing is different. From their perspective, the real question isn't how do we help our reps better sell, but rather how can our sales teams help our customer better buy. This process is predicated upon the major decision stages that nearly any customer will undergo, including one recognizing a need. This is where the customer initially determines a reason to explore a potential purchase, whether based upon an opportunity.\n"
